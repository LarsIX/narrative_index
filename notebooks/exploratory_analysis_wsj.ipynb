         "Advertisement\nBUSINESS\nTELECOM\nBest Buy-Owned Phone Service Faces Angry Customers After 3G Network Shutdown\nSome Jitterbug phone users have been unable to make calls for days\nBy\nWill Feuer\nFollow\nand\nThomas Gryta\nFollow\nJan. 10, 2023 10:45 am ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(6 min)\nBest Buy owns Lively, which sells easy-to-use cellphones and has said it would provide an update about service issues on Thursday. PHOTO: RACHEL WISNIEWSKI FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nWhen Teresa Kurtz’s 78-year-old mother accidentally locked herself out of her home last week in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, she pulled out her Jitterbug flip phone to seek help, only to discover no calls would go through. \n“This was one little instance where it’s like, oh my gosh, this is her lifeline,” said Ms. Kurtz, 60, about her mother, who lives alone and faced chilly temperatures before receiving help from a neighbor.\nMs. Kurtz’s mother is among users of the Best Buy Co.-owned BBY -0.72%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\nLively service, which sells easy-to-use cellphones and medical-alert devices to mostly older people. The company’s Jitterbug Flip phone stopped working for some customers after the start of the new year following the planned shutdown of Verizon Communications Inc.’s VZ 2.02%\nincrease; green up pointing triangle\n3G network on Dec. 31.\n“As a result of network updates made on Jan. 2, some customers with a Jitterbug Flip phone are experiencing a disruption to their service,” Best Buy BBY -0.72%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\nsaid. The company said it is working to resolve the issue and noted that Jitterbug Flip2 phones, Jitterbug smartphones and Lively-branded devices aren’t impacted. \nIn a message to affected customers, Lively said it expects to provide an update by Thursday. It didn’t give an estimate of when service would be restored or how many customers had issues with their devices. Lively told those customers to use a different device to contact 911 in the case of an emergency.\n“Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our customers, and as soon as we learned about the issue, we worked to notify customers that were potentially impacted,” Best Buy said. \nAfter discovering service problems, Ms. Kurtz said she and her mother thought there was an issue with the phone battery or the bill not being paid. After a few days, she said she called Lively and got a recorded message about the Jitterbug phone issue. She ordered a new phone for her mother and is switching her to another wireless provider, she said. \nFamily members of Lively customers said the company has offered new phones free in some instances, or discounts on purchasing upgraded devices. \nLast year, all three major U.S. cellular carriers shut down their older 3G networks to free up more wireless spectrum for the build-out of 5G. The majority of U.S. cellphone users have access to 4G or 5G networks, though some older models continued to depend on 3G right up until carriers shut down those networks. Apple Inc.’s iPhone 4S, released more than a decade ago, was the last one the company produced that solely connected on 3G or older networks.\nBest Buy acquired Lively, formerly named GreatCall, in 2018 for $800 million in cash. The service at that time had 900,000 paying subscribers and offered “easy-to-use mobile products and connected devices tailored for aging consumers.” \nLively is known as a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, which buys wholesale access to a wireless network instead of owning and operating it. For major wireless carriers, such arrangements let them sell excess capacity on their networks and gain customers without having to bear the costs of marketing to them or signing them up.\nCarriers generally don’t discuss wholesale agreements or even acknowledge which services run on their networks. Lively’s marketing materials say it is powered by “the nation’s most reliable wireless network,” language that Verizon used in its own wireless marketing for years. \nVerizon initially planned to shut down its 3G network in 2019 but extended the deadline until just before the calendar turned to 2023, months after rivals closed similar systems. Some trade groups petitioned carriers to delay network shutdowns amid concerns of impacts for certain equipment such as security and medical alert systems and phone service for Americans. \nThe extension was “an effort to minimize potential service disruptions and provide additional time for our customers to transition to newer and more advanced technologies and devices,” a Verizon spokesman said. “We’ve had no significant network issues related to this transition and shutdown.”\nA spokesman for the Federal Communications Commission declined to comment on the Lively situation.

PHOTO: ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nThe Biden administration on Tuesday released a detailed plan that will make it easier for student-loan holders to wipe out their debts using income-driven repayment plans.\nThe proposed rule from the Education Department is a key step in overhauling the $1.6 trillion federal loan program that has left millions with ballooning debts. The administration first announced the change in August when it unveiled its plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt for qualifying borrowers. The Supreme Court plans next month to take up a challenge to that broader debt-forgiveness, which is frozen after being blocked by lower courts.\nYOUR MONEY BRIEFING\nNew Student-Debt Plan Would Benefit Lower-Income Borrowers\n07:44\n1x\nSUBSCRIBE\nAdd to Queue\nExplore Audio Center\nIncome-driven repayment plans were designed to help lower earners borrow for college, but few have been able to use them effectively because of technical problems and onerous amounts of income-verification paperwork. If enacted, the proposed changes would provide qualifying borrowers with significantly more-generous options that could leave them debt-free sooner, while paying off only a fraction of their total loan balances. \nTo prevent student-debt balances from ballooning in the future, the administration plans to halve, to 5% from 10%, the amount of discretionary income borrowers must pay each month on their undergraduate loans if they are enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan. Borrowers with incomes below 225% of the federal poverty line wouldn’t have to make monthly payments on their loans. The administration estimated that that level corresponds to an individual income of less than roughly $30,600 annually or any borrower in a family of four who makes less than about $62,400 a year.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat do you think of the Biden Administration’s plan to overhaul income-driven repayment programs for student loans? Join the conversation below.\nBorrower loan balances won’t grow as long as they make their monthly payments, even if a low-income borrower’s monthly requirement is set at $0. The change would also forgive loan balances for people enrolled in income-based plans after 10 years of payments, down from 20 under many of the current options, for borrowers whose original loan balances were $12,000 or less.\n“We are, for the first time, creating a student-loan safety net in this country,” said Education Department Undersecretary James Kvaal.\nThe proposed rule now must go through a 30-day public-comment period, after which the department can release a final rule.\nBorrowers and members of both parties in Congress have criticized the existing income-driven repayment program as broken. A government watchdog report last year found that only 157 borrowers out of eight million enrolled in the program successfully had their debt forgiven after decades of payments. The program has existed since 1992.\nIn its regulatory notice, the administration acknowledged that the plan would lead to “increased costs of the student loan programs to the taxpayers in the form of transfers to borrowers who would pay less on their loans.” Some opponents of debt relief, including congressional Republicans, have criticized that arrangement as unfair to taxpayers who didn’t take out loans or who paid them off in full.\nPayment-plan changes could, over time, be nearly as costly as the mass debt-cancellation plan is projected to be. A University of Pennsylvania Wharton School model suggested a range of possible price tags for the changes to income-driven repayment ranging from around $70 billion over 10 years to $450 billion over a longer period, depending on enrollment, and whether colleges continue to raise costs. \nThe shortened repayment period for borrowers with less than $12,000 in debt could make some degree-granting programs, especially at community colleges, effectively free, according to some analysts. A Biden plan to provide free community college was nixed in spending talks with congressional Democrats. \nMany borrowers already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will be closer to debt forgiveness under changes announced by the Biden administration last year.

Borrowers who went into forbearance—a temporary payment freeze where interest continues to build up—for at least 36 months between July 2009 and March 2020 will receive at least three years of payment credit when payments resume later this year. \nThe Education Department said it would fix a longstanding problem where loan payments made to different servicers weren’t counted together, which can lead to undercounting of payments that qualify for eventual forgiveness. Those changes are likely to affect around 3.6 million borrowers, or nearly 10% of all holders of federal student loans.\nPayments and interest accrual on federal student loans have been frozen since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. They are now scheduled to resume 60 days after litigation over the loan-forgiveness program is resolved or the program is implemented.\nAdvertisement\nWrite to Gabriel T.

Many borrowers already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will be closer to debt forgiveness under changes announced administration last year. \"Based on how much typical community-college students pay for college and earn after graduation, it would allow a great many of them to be payment-free for 10 years, or close to it,\" wrote. Kevin. Carey, a higher-education expert at the nonpartisan. New. America. Foundation, in a. December analysis of the income-driven repayment plan based on the details the administration released last year. According to a fact sheet released. Tuesday, the. Department estimates that 85 of community-college borrowers would be debt free within 10 years of entering repayment. To cut down on the paperwork that discourages many borrowers from signing up or remaining enrolled in payment programs, the administration aims to automate much of the process, in part the. Internal. Revenue. Service to verify borrower incomes each year. Many borrowers already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will be closer to debt forgiveness under changes announced last year. Borrowers who went into forbearancea temporary payment freeze where interest continues to build upfor at least 36 months between. July and. March will receive at least three years of payment credit when payments resume later this year. The. Education. Department said it would fix a longstanding problem where loan payments made to different servicers weren't counted together, which can lead to undercounting of payments that qualify for eventual forgiveness. Those changes are likely to affect around 3.6 million borrowers, or nearly 10 of all holders of federal student loans. Payments and interest accrual on federal student loans have been frozen since the start of the pandemic in. March . They are now scheduled to resume 60 days after litigation over the loan-forgiveness program is resolved or the program is implemented. The. U.S. Nuclear. Base. Hidden. Under. Greenland's. Ice for.

Photo: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\nWASHINGTON—Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday named Robert Hur, a former U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, as special counsel to examine why classified documents were found at President Biden’s home and office, intensifying scrutiny of Mr. Biden’s actions after he left the vice presidency in 2017.\nThe appointment came after Mr. Biden’s lawyer said aides found classified records, likely dating from Mr. Biden’s time as vice president, at his Wilmington, Del., garage and at an office he used at a Washington-based think tank that bears his name. It heightens political pressure on the White House and sets up the unusual prospect of three concurrent Justice Department special counsels, two of whom are investigating the actions of the president or his chief rival for office. Lawmakers from both parties in Congress have also demanded details on the discovery of the documents.\nAsk WSJ\nWhat's Next for the GOP?\nThe recent House speakership battle could reflect a larger conflict within the Republican party over its electoral and governing strategy moving forward.

But under the regulations, the extraordinary circumstances here require the appointment of a special counsel for this matter,” Mr. Garland said, adding that he would ensure Mr. Hur got the resources he needed to conduct the probe. \nMr. Hur is a longtime federal prosecutor who was the U.S. attorney in Maryland during the Trump administration and a senior aide to the deputy attorney general. He clerked for the late U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist and prosecuted dozens of financial fraud, public corruption and other cases. He most recently was a defense lawyer in private practice. \nIn a brief order, Mr. Garland said Mr. Hur would examine the possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents found at Mr. Biden’s home and the think tank. “The Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,” the order said.    \n“I will conduct the assigned investigation with fair, impartial and dispassionate judgment,” Mr. Hur said in a statement, adding that he intended to “follow the facts swiftly and thoroughly without fear or favor.”\nMr. Hur’s work will be similar to that of another special counsel, Jack Smith, a longtime public-corruption and international prosecutor, who is running an investigation into former President Donald Trump’s potential mishandling of classified records and other matters. \nRobert Hur served as the U.S. attorney in Maryland in the Trump administration.

The president’s team conducted a search for any further documents, which was completed on Wednesday, Mr. Sauber said.  \nThe National Archives’s inspector general notified a Justice Department prosecutor on Nov. 4 that documents with classified markings had been discovered at the center, where they weren’t authorized to be, Mr. Garland said, offering the fullest timeline yet of the discovery. The FBI on Nov. 9 began assessing whether classified material had been mishandled in violation of federal law, and on Nov. 14, Mr. Garland tasked the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Chicago, John Lausch, with reviewing the documents.\nFive weeks later, on Dec. 20, Mr. Biden’s lawyers told Mr. Lausch that additional documents with classified markings dating to Mr. Biden’s time in the Obama administration had been discovered in the garage of Mr. Biden’s home in Wilmington, prompting the FBI to go there and retrieve them.\nThursday morning, Mr. Biden’s lawyer told Mr. Lausch that an additional document bearing classification markings was identified at the president’s home in Wilmington.\nMr. Lausch on Jan. 5 told Mr. Garland he believed further investigation by a special counsel was warranted, but that he couldn’t do that task himself because he intended to leave the department.\nResponding to repeated questioning Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said officials didn’t disclose additional documents sooner because the search and the Justice Department’s process were still ongoing. She also wouldn’t say what sparked the initial search for documents, and reiterated that Mr. Biden didn’t know what was in them.\nAdvertisement\nThe appointment of Mr. Hur adds a third special counsel to the Garland era at the Justice Department, which he has tried to insulate from partisan influence, appointing outside prosecutors even as he has attested to the department’s vaunted independence from political pressure.\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said the extraordinary circumstances required the special counsel’s appointment.

Mr. Weiss isn’t a special counsel but while other Trump U.S. attorneys left at the start of the administration, Mr. Garland kept Mr. Weiss on to similarly avoid the appearance of a conflict.\nWhile Mr. Garland and other senior Justice Department officials will be regularly briefed on the Biden documents investigation, any move to overrule a major decision by Mr. Hur would require them to notify Congress and explain their reasoning, per the special counsel regulations.\nAsked about the discovery of the latest batch of documents on Thursday, Mr. Biden said the documents had been in a locked garage with his Corvette sports car. “It’s not like they’re sitting out in the street,” he said. \nAfter reading language similar to his lawyer’s statement from the podium, the president said, “We’re going to see all this unfold,” adding, “I’m confident.”\nAsked if any countries had expressed concerns about the security of classified documents, John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said during a White House briefing Thursday: “I’m not aware of any such discussions or concerns.”\nRep.

ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP/GETTY IMAGES\nBy\nKen Thomas\nFollow\nand\nSabrina Siddiqui\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 13, 2023 5:52 pm ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(8 min)\nWASHINGTON—President Biden’s departure from the White House in January 2017 involved a rush to pack up documents and other belongings, former aides said, as the then-vice president embarked on an intense stretch of domestic and international travel and a series of official events.\nDuring those final weeks, staff members were tasked with packing up Mr. Biden’s West Wing office, where he did much of his work, along with his larger office space at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building near the White House and his residence at the Naval Observatory.\nThat push to close down Mr. Biden’s eight years as vice president has come under intense scrutiny with the recent revelations that classified documents from that period were recently found at a Washington office used by Mr. Biden, and later inside a garage in his home in Wilmington, Del., according to a lawyer for the president. \nMuch remains unknown about how the documents came to be in those places or who put them there, and the White House has declined to provide detailed answers. But the revelations have raised concerns about Mr. Biden’s handling of the nation’s secrets and put the White House on the defensive over the manner in which they disclosed to the public the scope of the mishandled classified documents. \nThe White House said aides had found “a small number” of documents with classified markings at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, Mr. Biden’s post-vice presidential think tank, on Nov. 2, six days before the midterm elections, and turned them over to the National Archives. \nThe White House also said that on Dec. 20, Mr. Biden’s lawyers informed the Justice Department that additional documents with classified markings dating back to Mr. Biden’s time as vice president had been discovered in the garage of Mr. Biden’s home in Wilmington, near his 1967 Corvette Stingray. That prompted the FBI to retrieve the material. On Thursday morning, Mr. Biden’s lawyer informed the government that an additional document bearing classified markings was identified at the president’s home in Wilmington.\nOn Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland named Robert Hur, a former U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, as special counsel to examine the classified documents case.\nBiden ‘Cooperating Fully’ With DOJ as Garland Appoints Special Counsel\nPlay video: Biden ‘Cooperating Fully’ With DOJ as Garland Appoints Special Counsel\nPresident Biden said Thursday a “small number” of classified documents from his time as vice president were found at his home and in his personal library.

The president, during a news conference Tuesday that capped off a visit to Mexico, said he was surprised by the discovery and was cooperating on the matter. \nMr. Biden’s lawyer, Richard Sauber, has said the White House is confident that the Justice Department review “will show that these documents were inadvertently misplaced, and the president and his lawyers acted promptly upon discovery of this mistake.”\nRepublicans have accused the Justice Department of maintaining a double standard on the issue of retention of classified documents because it obtained a warrant to search the Florida home of former President Donald Trump over his holding of top secret documents as part of a criminal investigation. \nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWSJ Politics & Policy\nScoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nThe Justice Department has indicated that part of its investigation includes potential obstruction, after the issue was referred to prosecutors by the National Archives following months of negotiations with Mr. Trump’s lawyers. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and described the investigation as a witch hunt. \nSome of President Biden’s current advisers worked with him during his final days as vice president, including counselor Steve Ricchetti, who was Mr. Biden’s last vice presidential chief of staff, communications director Kate Bedingfield, who held the same position from 2015 to 2017, and chief speechwriter Vinay Reddy. The White House has referred questions about the documents to the Justice Department, which declined to comment.\nFormer aides said the vice president’s general counsel’s office oversaw the documents retention process. Mr. Biden’s executive assistant at the time, Kathy Chung, was most heavily involved in the packing up of the office, according to former aides, but was helped by other lower-level staff members.\nMs. Chung, who now serves as deputy director of protocol for Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, was interviewed by federal investigators late last year about the discovered documents, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Pentagon on Friday declined to make Ms. Chung available for comment and referred calls to the Justice Department, which declined to comment. \nThe Washington, D.C., office building that houses the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, Mr. Biden’s post-vice presidential think tank, where aides discovered ‘a small number’ of classified documents last year. PHOTO: JIM LO SCALZO/SHUTTERSTOCK\nFormer aides described a frenetic few weeks before Mr. Trump took office as Mr. Biden crisscrossed the nation and embarked on a final foreign trip to Ukraine and Switzerland shortly before the inauguration. That busy travel schedule created new documents and papers up until the final day and complicated the packing process, they said. With many senior staff members on the road with Mr. Biden, some aides described a depleted staff in Washington trying to clear the vice president’s offices as the transition of power loomed. \nSome members of Mr. Biden staff had already departed their roles, they said, and those who remained worked to maintain daily briefings and operations in a hectic final sprint while sorting through documents and belongings that were no longer needed.\nDuring his final two weeks, Mr. Biden presided over Congress for the counting of the electoral votes for the 2016 election, and then took a trip to California, where he appeared at a fundraiser for then Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and delivered a speech at a healthcare conference in San Francisco. After departing California, Mr. Biden attended an event in Chicago with outgoing President Barack Obama and then stopped in Detroit to visit the North American International Auto Show.\nAdvertisement\nDays later, Mr. Biden was surprised by Mr. Obama with the presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House, an event that brought together the then-vice president’s large extended family. \nMr. Biden then traveled to New York for an appearance on ABC’s “The View,” where he noted that he had personally written a classified memorandum for Vice President-elect Mike Pence. “He’ll call me and ask about, or I’ll call him about what’s going on in Ukraine, what’s going on here, what’s going on there,” Mr. Biden said at the time.\nThe capstone of his final days was a trip to Kyiv for a meeting with then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Among the classified documents discovered in the locales associated with Mr. Biden was a briefing paper related to Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nVice President Biden in Kyiv, Ukraine, with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, on one of Mr. Biden’s final days in office in January 2017. PHOTO: SERGII KHARCHENKO/NURPHOTO/GETTY IMAGES\nFrom there, Mr. Biden flew to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum, where he addressed the forum, quipping to the audience, “I’ll be vice president of the United States for 48 more hours.” The stop in Davos included a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Mr. Biden and his aides landed back at Joint Base Andrews on the evening of Jan. 18, with the inauguration a little more than a day away. \nWhile aboard Air Force Two, Mr. Biden spoke with the prime minister of Kosovo in an effort to defuse tensions with Serbia, and held separate conversations with the leaders of the Republic of Cyprus, Northern Cyprus and Greece to discuss settlement talks in the region. His final days in office also included a call with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi regarding the fight against ISIL, and a meeting with the prime minister of Ukraine during his stop in Kyiv.\nThe General Services Administration, a government agency, provides logistical support at the end of each administration. A GSA spokesman said outgoing White House staff “are responsible for substantive determinations about handling documents (e.g., collecting, reviewing, and categorizing documents, as well as determining where documents should be transported to).”\nThe spokesman said in 2017 the GSA provided about 5,300 square feet of office space to Mr. Biden’s transition team near the White House, and the team vacated the space on July 21, 2017.\nAt the time, Mr. Biden was in the process of renting a home in McLean, Va., where he lived for much of the Trump presidency, allowing the Bidens to be close to some of their grandchildren who lived in the Washington, D.C., area. The Bidens would also spend time at their Wilmington home after Mr. Biden left office.\nMr. Biden’s office at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, near the U.S. Capitol, didn’t officially open until February 2018.\nAruna Viswanatha, Sadie Gurman and Gordon Lubold contributed to this article.\nClassified Documents Found at President Biden's Home\nThe political and potential legal fallout of the discovery\nWhat We Know About the Classified Documents\nThe Biden Documents: A Timeline\nLeaving White House as VP, a Scramble to Pack\nClassified Documents Found at Biden’s Think Tank\nWrite to Ken Thomas at ken.thomas@wsj.com and Sabrina Siddiqui at sabrina.siddiqui@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 14, 2023, print edition as 'Biden Team Rushed to Pack Papers in 2017'.\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nFurther Reading\nOPINION\nDemocrats Are Stuck in the Soup\nTrump Officials Balk at RFK Jr.’s Attack on Pesticides\nTrump Clash With Library of Congress Sets Up Constitutional Fight\nThe Wild West of Presidential Pardons in Trump’s Second Term\nWith Qatari Plane Talks, Trump Sends Message to World: He’s Open for Business",

         "Before Biden Left the White House as Vice President, a Scramble to Pack Documents Before. Biden. Left the. White. House as. Vice. President, a. Scramble to. Pack. Documents. A moving van at the. White. House in. Washington,. D.C., on. Jan. 20,. Inauguration. Day, . ANDREW. CABALLERO-REYNOLDSAFPGETTY. IMAGES 8 min. WASHINGTONPresident. Biden's departure from the. White. House in. January involved a rush to pack up documents and other belongings, former aides said, as the then-vice president embarked on an intense stretch of domestic and international travel and a series of official events. During those final weeks, staff members were tasked with packing up. Mr. Biden's. West. Wing office, where he did much of his work, along with his larger office space at the. Eisenhower. Executive. Office. Building near the. White. House and his residence at the. Naval. Observatory. That push to close down. Mr. Biden's eight years as vice president has come under intense scrutiny with the recent revelations that classified documents from that period were recently found at a. Washington office used by. Mr. Biden, and later inside a garage in his home in. Wilmington,. Del., according to a lawyer for the president. Much remains unknown about how the documents came to be in those places or who put them there, and the. White. House has declined to provide detailed answers. But the revelations have raised concerns about. Mr. Biden's handling of the nation's secrets and put the. White. House on the defensive over the manner in which they disclosed to the public the scope of the mishandled classified documents. The. White. House said aides had found \"a small number\" of documents with classified markings at the. Penn. Biden. Center for. Diplomacy and. Global. Engagement,. Mr. Biden's post-vice presidential think tank, on. Nov. 2, six days before the midterm elections, and turned them over to the. National. Archives. The. White. House also said that on. Dec. 20,. Mr. Biden's lawyers informed the. Justice. Department that additional documents with classified markings dating back to. Mr. Biden's time as vice president had been discovered in the garage of. Mr. Biden's home in. Wilmington, near his. Corvette. Stingray. That prompted the. FBI to retrieve the material. On. Thursday morning,. Mr. Biden's lawyer informed the government that an additional document bearing classified markings was identified at the president's home in. Wilmington. On. Thursday,. Attorney. General. Merrick. Garland named. Robert. Hur, a former. U.S. attorney during the. Trump administration, as special counsel to examine the classified documents case. President. Biden said. Thursday a \"small number\" of classified documents from his time as vice president were found at his home and in his personal library. Attorney. General. Merrick. Garland outlined the decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate. The. White. House has said. Mr. Biden didn't know the documents had been stored in the two locations nor did he know what was in the documents. The president, during a news conference. Tuesday that capped off a visit to. Mexico, said he was surprised and was cooperating on the matter. Mr. Biden's lawyer,. Richard. Sauber, has said the. White. House is confident that the. Justice. Department review \"will show that these documents were inadvertently misplaced, and the president and his lawyers acted promptly upon discovery of this mistake.\". Republicans have accused the. Justice. Department of maintaining a double standard on the issue of retention of classified documents because it obtained a warrant to search the. Florida home of former. President. Donald. Trump over his holding of top secret documents as part of a criminal investigation. The. Justice. Department has indicated that part of its investigation includes potential obstruction, after the issue was referred to prosecutors. Archives following months of negotiations with. Mr. Trump's has denied wrongdoing and described the investigation as a witch hunt. Some of. President. Biden's current advisers worked with him during his final days as vice president, including counselor. Steve. Ricchetti, who was. Mr. Biden's last vice presidential chief of staff, communications director. Kate. Bedingfield, who held the same position from to , and chief speechwriter. Vinay. Reddy. The. White. House has referred questions about the documents to the. Justice. Department, which declined to comment. Former aides said the vice president's general counsel's office oversaw the documents retention 's executive assistant at the time,. Kathy. Chung, was most heavily involved in the packing up of the office, according to former aides, but was helped -level staff members. Ms. Chung, who now serves as deputy director of protocol for. Defense. Secretary. Lloyd. Austin, was interviewed late last year about the discovered documents, according to a person familiar with the matter. The. Pentagon on. Friday declined to make. Ms. Chung available for comment and referred calls to the. Justice. Department, which declined to comment. The. Washington,. D.C., office building that houses the. Penn. Biden. Center for. Diplomacy and. Global. Engagement,. Mr. Biden's post-vice presidential think tank, where aides discovered 'a small number' of classified documents last year. Former aides described a frenetic few weeks before. Mr. Trump took office as. Mr. Biden crisscrossed the nation and embarked on a final foreign trip to. Ukraine and. Switzerland shortly before the inauguration. That busy travel schedule created new documents and papers up until the final day and complicated the packing process, they said. With many senior staff members on the road with. Mr. Biden, some aides described a depleted staff in. Washington trying to clear the vice president's offices as the transition of power loomed. Some members of. Mr. Biden staff had already departed their roles, they said, and those who remained worked to maintain daily briefings and operations in a hectic final sprint while sorting through documents and belongings that were no longer needed. During his final two weeks,. Mr. Biden presided over. Congress for the counting of the electoral votes for the election, and then took a trip to. California, where he appeared at a fundraiser for then. Los. Angeles. Mayor. Eric. Garcetti and delivered a speech at a healthcare conference in. San. Francisco. After departing. California,. Mr. Biden attended an event in. Chicago with outgoing. President. Barack. Obama and then stopped in. Detroit to visit the. North. American. International. Auto. Show. Days later,. Mr. Biden was surprised by. Mr. Obama with the presentation of the. Presidential. Medal of. Freedom at the. White.
