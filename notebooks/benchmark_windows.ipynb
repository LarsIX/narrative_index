The company said it is working to resolve the issue and noted that Jitterbug Flip2 phones, Jitterbug smartphones and Lively-branded devices aren’t impacted. \nIn a message to affected customers, Lively said it expects to provide an update by Thursday. It didn’t give an estimate of when service would be restored or how many customers had issues with their devices. Lively told those customers to use a different device to contact 911 in the case of an emergency.\n“Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our customers, and as soon as we learned about the issue, we worked to notify customers that were potentially impacted,” Best Buy said. \nAfter discovering service problems, Ms. Kurtz said she and her mother thought there was an issue with the phone battery or the bill not being paid. After a few days, she said she called Lively and got a recorded message about the Jitterbug phone issue. She ordered a new phone for her mother and is switching her to another wireless provider, she said. \nFamily members of Lively customers said the company has offered new phones free in some instances, or discounts on purchasing upgraded devices. \nLast year, all three major U.S. cellular carriers shut down their older 3G networks to free up more wireless spectrum for the build-out of 5G. The majority of U.S. cellphone users have access to 4G or 5G networks, though some older models continued to depend on 3G right up until carriers shut down those networks. Apple Inc.’s iPhone 4S, released more than a decade ago, was the last one the company produced that solely connected on 3G or older networks.\nBest Buy acquired Lively, formerly named GreatCall, in 2018 for $800 million in cash. The service at that time had 900,000 paying subscribers and offered “easy-to-use mobile products and connected devices tailored for aging consumers.” \nLively is known as a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, which buys wholesale access to a wireless network instead of owning and operating it. For major wireless carriers, such arrangements let them sell excess capacity on their networks and gain customers without having to bear the costs of marketing to them or signing them up.\nCarriers generally don’t discuss wholesale agreements or even acknowledge which services run on their networks. Lively’s marketing materials say it is powered by “the nation’s most reliable wireless network,” language that Verizon used in its own wireless marketing for years. \nVerizon initially planned to shut down its 3G network in 2019 but extended the deadline until just before the calendar turned to 2023, months after rivals closed similar systems. Some trade groups petitioned carriers to delay network shutdowns amid concerns of impacts for certain equipment such as security and medical alert systems and phone service for Americans. \nThe extension was “an effort to minimize potential service disruptions and provide additional time for our customers to transition to newer and more advanced technologies and devices,” a Verizon spokesman said. “We’ve had no significant network issues related to this transition and shutdown.”\nA spokesman for the Federal Communications Commission declined to comment on the Lively situation. The FCC has issued consumer warnings about the 3G shutdown and advised users to contact their mobile carrier ahead of time to determine whether service could be impacted.\nSome Jitterbug users were unaware of any coming changes to service related to 3G network shutdowns, according to their family members.\nDena Bisnette of Newton, Kan., said she had heard last year about the shutdown of the 3G network, and called Lively to ask if it would affect her Jitterbug flip phone. A company representative told her the flip phone could be reprogrammed for 4G, she said, but her phone stopped working last week. Ms. Bisnette said she ordered an upgraded Jitterbug Flip2 phone.\nFor 96-year-old Marjorie Rees, her Jitterbug flip phone is how she reaches loved ones from her retirement community, which doesn’t provide landline service for residents, one of her family members said.\n“I’m really at wits end, her phone just goes directly to voice mail when you call,” said her son Christopher Rees, 58, of Fredericksburg, Texas. He has tried Lively customer service, but they gave him similar information that is posted on the website and no explanation of the problem or how to fix it. \n“She is agitated and worried that she is going to miss a phone call,” he said. “For my mom’s sake, I’ve got to get her a new phone.”\nEarlier: In February 2022, U.S. cellular carriers began shutting down 3G.

PHOTO: ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nThe Biden administration on Tuesday released a detailed plan that will make it easier for student-loan holders to wipe out their debts using income-driven repayment plans.\nThe proposed rule from the Education Department is a key step in overhauling the $1.6 trillion federal loan program that has left millions with ballooning debts. The administration first announced the change in August when it unveiled its plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt for qualifying borrowers. The Supreme Court plans next month to take up a challenge to that broader debt-forgiveness, which is frozen after being blocked by lower courts.\nYOUR MONEY BRIEFING\nNew Student-Debt Plan Would Benefit Lower-Income Borrowers\n07:44\n1x\nSUBSCRIBE\nAdd to Queue\nExplore Audio Center\nIncome-driven repayment plans were designed to help lower earners borrow for college, but few have been able to use them effectively because of technical problems and onerous amounts of income-verification paperwork. If enacted, the proposed changes would provide qualifying borrowers with significantly more-generous options that could leave them debt-free sooner, while paying off only a fraction of their total loan balances. \nTo prevent student-debt balances from ballooning in the future, the administration plans to halve, to 5% from 10%, the amount of discretionary income borrowers must pay each month on their undergraduate loans if they are enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan. Borrowers with incomes below 225% of the federal poverty line wouldn’t have to make monthly payments on their loans. The administration estimated that that level corresponds to an individual income of less than roughly $30,600 annually or any borrower in a family of four who makes less than about $62,400 a year.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat do you think of the Biden Administration’s plan to overhaul income-driven repayment programs for student loans? Join the conversation below.\nBorrower loan balances won’t grow as long as they make their monthly payments, even if a low-income borrower’s monthly requirement is set at $0. The change would also forgive loan balances for people enrolled in income-based plans after 10 years of payments, down from 20 under many of the current options, for borrowers whose original loan balances were $12,000 or less.\n“We are, for the first time, creating a student-loan safety net in this country,” said Education Department Undersecretary James Kvaal.\nThe proposed rule now must go through a 30-day public-comment period, after which the department can release a final rule.\nBorrowers and members of both parties in Congress have criticized the existing income-driven repayment program as broken. A government watchdog report last year found that only 157 borrowers out of eight million enrolled in the program successfully had their debt forgiven after decades of payments. The program has existed since 1992.\nIn its regulatory notice, the administration acknowledged that the plan would lead to “increased costs of the student loan programs to the taxpayers in the form of transfers to borrowers who would pay less on their loans.” Some opponents of debt relief, including congressional Republicans, have criticized that arrangement as unfair to taxpayers who didn’t take out loans or who paid them off in full.\nPayment-plan changes could, over time, be nearly as costly as the mass debt-cancellation plan is projected to be. A University of Pennsylvania Wharton School model suggested a range of possible price tags for the changes to income-driven repayment ranging from around $70 billion over 10 years to $450 billion over a longer period, depending on enrollment, and whether colleges continue to raise costs. \nThe shortened repayment period for borrowers with less than $12,000 in debt could make some degree-granting programs, especially at community colleges, effectively free, according to some analysts. A Biden plan to provide free community college was nixed in spending talks with congressional Democrats. \nMany borrowers already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will be closer to debt forgiveness under changes announced by the Biden administration last year. PHOTO: SAUL LOEB/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\n“Based on how much typical community-college students pay for college and earn after graduation, it would allow a great many of them to be payment-free for 10 years, or close to it,” wrote Kevin Carey, a higher-education expert at the nonpartisan New America Foundation, in a December analysis of the income-driven repayment plan based on the details the administration released last year. \nAccording to a fact sheet released Tuesday, the Department estimates that 85% of community-college borrowers would be debt free within 10 years of entering repayment.\nTo cut down on the paperwork that discourages many borrowers from signing up or remaining enrolled in payment programs, the administration aims to automate much of the process, in part by working with the Internal Revenue Service to verify borrower incomes each year.\nMany borrowers already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will be closer to debt forgiveness under changes announced by the administration last year. Borrowers who went into forbearance—a temporary payment freeze where interest continues to build up—for at least 36 months between July 2009 and March 2020 will receive at least three years of payment credit when payments resume later this year. \nThe Education Department said it would fix a longstanding problem where loan payments made to different servicers weren’t counted together, which can lead to undercounting of payments that qualify for eventual forgiveness. Those changes are likely to affect around 3.6 million borrowers, or nearly 10% of all holders of federal student loans.\nPayments and interest accrual on federal student loans have been frozen since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. They are now scheduled to resume 60 days after litigation over the loan-forgiveness program is resolved or the program is implemented.\nAdvertisement\nWrite to Gabriel T.

To cut down on the paperwork that discourages many borrowers from signing up or remaining enrolled in payment programs, the administration aims to automate much of the process, in part the. Internal. Revenue. Service to verify borrower incomes each year. Many borrowers already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will be closer to debt forgiveness under changes announced last year. Borrowers who went into forbearancea temporary payment freeze where interest continues to build upfor at least 36 months between. July and. March will receive at least three years of payment credit when payments resume later this year. The. Education. Department said it would fix a longstanding problem where loan payments made to different servicers weren't counted together, which can lead to undercounting of payments that qualify for eventual forgiveness. Those changes are likely to affect around 3.6 million borrowers, or nearly 10 of all holders of federal student loans. Payments and interest accrual on federal student loans have been frozen since the start of the pandemic in. March . They are now scheduled to resume 60 days after litigation over the loan-forgiveness program is resolved or the program is implemented. The. U.S. Nuclear. Base. Hidden. Under. Greenland's. Ice for.

Photo: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\nWASHINGTON—Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday named Robert Hur, a former U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, as special counsel to examine why classified documents were found at President Biden’s home and office, intensifying scrutiny of Mr. Biden’s actions after he left the vice presidency in 2017.\nThe appointment came after Mr. Biden’s lawyer said aides found classified records, likely dating from Mr. Biden’s time as vice president, at his Wilmington, Del., garage and at an office he used at a Washington-based think tank that bears his name. It heightens political pressure on the White House and sets up the unusual prospect of three concurrent Justice Department special counsels, two of whom are investigating the actions of the president or his chief rival for office. Lawmakers from both parties in Congress have also demanded details on the discovery of the documents.\nAsk WSJ\nWhat's Next for the GOP?\nThe recent House speakership battle could reflect a larger conflict within the Republican party over its electoral and governing strategy moving forward.

But under the regulations, the extraordinary circumstances here require the appointment of a special counsel for this matter,” Mr. Garland said, adding that he would ensure Mr. Hur got the resources he needed to conduct the probe. \nMr. Hur is a longtime federal prosecutor who was the U.S. attorney in Maryland during the Trump administration and a senior aide to the deputy attorney general. He clerked for the late U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist and prosecuted dozens of financial fraud, public corruption and other cases. He most recently was a defense lawyer in private practice. \nIn a brief order, Mr. Garland said Mr. Hur would examine the possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents found at Mr. Biden’s home and the think tank. “The Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,” the order said.    \n“I will conduct the assigned investigation with fair, impartial and dispassionate judgment,” Mr. Hur said in a statement, adding that he intended to “follow the facts swiftly and thoroughly without fear or favor.”\nMr. Hur’s work will be similar to that of another special counsel, Jack Smith, a longtime public-corruption and international prosecutor, who is running an investigation into former President Donald Trump’s potential mishandling of classified records and other matters. \nRobert Hur served as the U.S. attorney in Maryland in the Trump administration. PHOTO: CHIP SOMODEVILLA/GETTY IMAGES\n“We have cooperated closely with the Justice Department throughout its review, and we will continue that cooperation with the Special Counsel,” Mr. Biden’s lawyer, Richard Sauber, said in a statement Thursday, adding that the documents were “inadvertently misplaced.”\nThe appointment was the latest of several developments this week after the White House confirmed news reports that aides had found documents with classified markings at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, the president’s Washington-based think tank, on Nov. 2, and turned them over to the National Archives. The president’s team conducted a search for any further documents, which was completed on Wednesday, Mr. Sauber said.  \nThe National Archives’s inspector general notified a Justice Department prosecutor on Nov. 4 that documents with classified markings had been discovered at the center, where they weren’t authorized to be, Mr. Garland said, offering the fullest timeline yet of the discovery. The FBI on Nov. 9 began assessing whether classified material had been mishandled in violation of federal law, and on Nov. 14, Mr. Garland tasked the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Chicago, John Lausch, with reviewing the documents.\nFive weeks later, on Dec. 20, Mr. Biden’s lawyers told Mr. Lausch that additional documents with classified markings dating to Mr. Biden’s time in the Obama administration had been discovered in the garage of Mr. Biden’s home in Wilmington, prompting the FBI to go there and retrieve them.\nThursday morning, Mr. Biden’s lawyer told Mr. Lausch that an additional document bearing classification markings was identified at the president’s home in Wilmington.\nMr. Lausch on Jan. 5 told Mr. Garland he believed further investigation by a special counsel was warranted, but that he couldn’t do that task himself because he intended to leave the department.\nResponding to repeated questioning Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said officials didn’t disclose additional documents sooner because the search and the Justice Department’s process were still ongoing. She also wouldn’t say what sparked the initial search for documents, and reiterated that Mr. Biden didn’t know what was in them.\nAdvertisement\nThe appointment of Mr. Hur adds a third special counsel to the Garland era at the Justice Department, which he has tried to insulate from partisan influence, appointing outside prosecutors even as he has attested to the department’s vaunted independence from political pressure.\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said the extraordinary circumstances required the special counsel’s appointment.

Mr. Weiss isn’t a special counsel but while other Trump U.S. attorneys left at the start of the administration, Mr. Garland kept Mr. Weiss on to similarly avoid the appearance of a conflict.\nWhile Mr. Garland and other senior Justice Department officials will be regularly briefed on the Biden documents investigation, any move to overrule a major decision by Mr. Hur would require them to notify Congress and explain their reasoning, per the special counsel regulations.\nAsked about the discovery of the latest batch of documents on Thursday, Mr. Biden said the documents had been in a locked garage with his Corvette sports car. “It’s not like they’re sitting out in the street,” he said. \nAfter reading language similar to his lawyer’s statement from the podium, the president said, “We’re going to see all this unfold,” adding, “I’m confident.”\nAsked if any countries had expressed concerns about the security of classified documents, John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said during a White House briefing Thursday: “I’m not aware of any such discussions or concerns.”\nRep.

But the revelations have raised concerns about Mr. Biden’s handling of the nation’s secrets and put the White House on the defensive over the manner in which they disclosed to the public the scope of the mishandled classified documents. \nThe White House said aides had found “a small number” of documents with classified markings at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, Mr. Biden’s post-vice presidential think tank, on Nov. 2, six days before the midterm elections, and turned them over to the National Archives. \nThe White House also said that on Dec. 20, Mr. Biden’s lawyers informed the Justice Department that additional documents with classified markings dating back to Mr. Biden’s time as vice president had been discovered in the garage of Mr. Biden’s home in Wilmington, near his 1967 Corvette Stingray. That prompted the FBI to retrieve the material. On Thursday morning, Mr. Biden’s lawyer informed the government that an additional document bearing classified markings was identified at the president’s home in Wilmington.\nOn Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland named Robert Hur, a former U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, as special counsel to examine the classified documents case.\nBiden ‘Cooperating Fully’ With DOJ as Garland Appoints Special Counsel\nPlay video: Biden ‘Cooperating Fully’ With DOJ as Garland Appoints Special Counsel\nPresident Biden said Thursday a “small number” of classified documents from his time as vice president were found at his home and in his personal library.

The president, during a news conference Tuesday that capped off a visit to Mexico, said he was surprised by the discovery and was cooperating on the matter. \nMr. Biden’s lawyer, Richard Sauber, has said the White House is confident that the Justice Department review “will show that these documents were inadvertently misplaced, and the president and his lawyers acted promptly upon discovery of this mistake.”\nRepublicans have accused the Justice Department of maintaining a double standard on the issue of retention of classified documents because it obtained a warrant to search the Florida home of former President Donald Trump over his holding of top secret documents as part of a criminal investigation. \nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWSJ Politics & Policy\nScoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nThe Justice Department has indicated that part of its investigation includes potential obstruction, after the issue was referred to prosecutors by the National Archives following months of negotiations with Mr. Trump’s lawyers. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and described the investigation as a witch hunt. \nSome of President Biden’s current advisers worked with him during his final days as vice president, including counselor Steve Ricchetti, who was Mr. Biden’s last vice presidential chief of staff, communications director Kate Bedingfield, who held the same position from 2015 to 2017, and chief speechwriter Vinay Reddy. The White House has referred questions about the documents to the Justice Department, which declined to comment.\nFormer aides said the vice president’s general counsel’s office oversaw the documents retention process. Mr. Biden’s executive assistant at the time, Kathy Chung, was most heavily involved in the packing up of the office, according to former aides, but was helped by other lower-level staff members.\nMs. Chung, who now serves as deputy director of protocol for Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, was interviewed by federal investigators late last year about the discovered documents, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Pentagon on Friday declined to make Ms. Chung available for comment and referred calls to the Justice Department, which declined to comment. \nThe Washington, D.C., office building that houses the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, Mr. Biden’s post-vice presidential think tank, where aides discovered ‘a small number’ of classified documents last year.

That busy travel schedule created new documents and papers up until the final day and complicated the packing process, they said. With many senior staff members on the road with Mr. Biden, some aides described a depleted staff in Washington trying to clear the vice president’s offices as the transition of power loomed. \nSome members of Mr. Biden staff had already departed their roles, they said, and those who remained worked to maintain daily briefings and operations in a hectic final sprint while sorting through documents and belongings that were no longer needed.\nDuring his final two weeks, Mr. Biden presided over Congress for the counting of the electoral votes for the 2016 election, and then took a trip to California, where he appeared at a fundraiser for then Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and delivered a speech at a healthcare conference in San Francisco. After departing California, Mr. Biden attended an event in Chicago with outgoing President Barack Obama and then stopped in Detroit to visit the North American International Auto Show.\nAdvertisement\nDays later, Mr. Biden was surprised by Mr. Obama with the presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House, an event that brought together the then-vice president’s large extended family. \nMr. Biden then traveled to New York for an appearance on ABC’s “The View,” where he noted that he had personally written a classified memorandum for Vice President-elect Mike Pence. “He’ll call me and ask about, or I’ll call him about what’s going on in Ukraine, what’s going on here, what’s going on there,” Mr. Biden said at the time.\nThe capstone of his final days was a trip to Kyiv for a meeting with then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Among the classified documents discovered in the locales associated with Mr. Biden was a briefing paper related to Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nVice President Biden in Kyiv, Ukraine, with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, on one of Mr. Biden’s final days in office in January 2017.

Mr. Biden and his aides landed back at Joint Base Andrews on the evening of Jan. 18, with the inauguration a little more than a day away. \nWhile aboard Air Force Two, Mr. Biden spoke with the prime minister of Kosovo in an effort to defuse tensions with Serbia, and held separate conversations with the leaders of the Republic of Cyprus, Northern Cyprus and Greece to discuss settlement talks in the region. His final days in office also included a call with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi regarding the fight against ISIL, and a meeting with the prime minister of Ukraine during his stop in Kyiv.\nThe General Services Administration, a government agency, provides logistical support at the end of each administration. A GSA spokesman said outgoing White House staff “are responsible for substantive determinations about handling documents (e.g., collecting, reviewing, and categorizing documents, as well as determining where documents should be transported to).”\nThe spokesman said in 2017 the GSA provided about 5,300 square feet of office space to Mr. Biden’s transition team near the White House, and the team vacated the space on July 21, 2017.\nAt the time, Mr. Biden was in the process of renting a home in McLean, Va., where he lived for much of the Trump presidency, allowing the Bidens to be close to some of their grandchildren who lived in the Washington, D.C., area.

It also said the U.K. will start training Ukrainian armed forces on the tanks and guns in coming days.\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWhat’s News\nCatch up on the headlines, understand the news and make better decisions, free in your inbox daily.

A top German official said Germany would follow up on its pledge to send main battle tanks if other Western allies do so.\nMr. Zelensky tweeted that the U.K.’s decision “will not only strengthen us on the battlefield, but also send the right signal to other partners.” The commander in chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in December that the army needs 300 tanks to win back territory the Russians conquered last year, an analysis that Western military officials agree with. \nIn its statement, the British government said it would accelerate diplomatic and military support to aid Ukraine’s efforts to push back Russian forces as the anniversary of the war approaches late next month. “The Prime Minister is clear that a long and static war only serves Russia’s ends,” the statement said.\nThe initial provision of a small number of advanced tanks won’t by itself make a big or immediate difference on the battlefield, said Franz-Stefan Gady, a fellow with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. The logistics of setting up supply chains, fuel lines and trained crews for the complex machinery means the West isn’t likely to be able to deliver tanks in the kinds of numbers that would make a significant impact for at least many months to come.\nChallenger 2 tanks in a NATO exercise last spring in Estonia. PHOTO: BEN BIRCHALL/PA WIRE/ZUMA PRESS\nThat said, even providing a few dozen tanks means creating the repair yards and logistical centers that could make it much easier to send the next round of heavy combat vehicles. It signals a lasting commitment to building up Ukraine’s military, countering Russian President Vladimir Putin’s bet that the West will soon tire of aiding Ukraine, said Mr. Gady.\n“It will send a clear message that the West is in for the long haul,” he said. “Even for these small [numbers of] tanks you would need to build up a logistical supply chain. You could slowly build on that.”\nThere are some 2,000 Leopard 2 tanks held by 13 militaries across Europe including Turkey, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank. It notes that global stocks of these tanks are in varying states of readiness. Canada, for example, has an inventory of more than 80, but half are set aside for training purposes. For the moment, the only other country that has made a specific pledge is Poland, which has offered a company—typically 14 tanks.\nThe Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which coordinates support for Ukraine and includes defense ministers and military officials from around the world, is due to meet Jan 20. Members are expected to discuss how best to support Kyiv. German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said Thursday that Germany shouldn’t stand in the way of countries that want to send Leopards to Ukraine.\nRussia’s Embassy in the U.K. said Saturday that the tanks are “unlikely to help the Armed Forces of Ukraine turn the tide on the battlefield, and they will become a legitimate large target for Russian guns,” in comments carried by Russian state news agency TASS.\nBritish officials believe that, as the war in Ukraine shifts to a new phase, it makes sense to provide the Ukrainian army with heavy armor, something that was almost inconceivable just a few months ago. Russia is mobilizing personnel to the front lines, such as at the eastern city of Bakhmut, creating a numerical advantage that could work against Ukraine. If Ukraine is to mount a spring counterattack, it needs tanks to clear Russian lines without incurring huge losses in personnel, according to military analysts.\nAdvertisement\nFrance has pledged to send AMX-10 armored vehicles to Ukraine. PHOTO: EMMANUEL DUNAND/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nMoreover, some British officials feel that the West needs to more aggressively tilt the advantage in Ukraine’s favor with a larger supply of weapons to quickly help Ukraine into a position of relative strength from which it can negotiate an end to the war with Russia. Without this infusion of weaponry, they fear the war could drag on for years.  \nThe British Army’s Challenger 2 is more than two decades old, but it will still be the most advanced tank the Ukrainians have fielded in battle. Up until now, most of the heavy armor provided by NATO allies such as Poland have been old Soviet-era tanks. The U.K. has a stock of around 227 Challenger 2 tanks and is in the process of replacing them with a modernized version.  \nBiden administration officials have said they don’t object to other countries providing tanks and welcome the British contribution. Meanwhile, they remain open to providing U.S. Abrams tanks to Ukraine but haven’t decided to do so, nor do they anticipate that tanks would be announced in the near future, officials said this past week. \n“This is something that we absolutely agree that Ukraine does need tanks,” said Laura Cooper, a top Pentagon policy official, earlier this month. But the U.S. remains worried about the training and logistics required to use an Abrams tank, which Ms. Cooper said is a “gas guzzler.”\nThe U.S. wants to make sure Ukrainians can operate and maintain the tanks before the U.S. provides them, administration officials said. In addition to the British tanks, the U.S. and the Netherlands paid to refurbish T-72 tanks, which are arriving on the battlefield in Ukraine this month. \nUntil recent weeks, the issue of tanks was largely taboo. Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other allies such as Australia supplied armored military vehicles that separately have many characteristics of tanks, such as heavy armor, big guns and caterpillar treads, but not all in one system.\nFrance recently said it would send AMX-10s, which have a cannon but are considered light tanks because they have wheels rather than treads. The U.S. said earlier this month that it plans to send Bradley Fighting Vehicles, which have treads and heavy armor but don’t carry a large cannon, as a main battle tank does.\nBojan Pancevski contributed to this article.\nWrite to Max Colchester at Max.Colchester@wsj.com and Drew Hinshaw at drew.hinshaw@wsj.com\nThe War in Ukraine\nNews and insights, selected by the editors\nThe Tensions Surrounding Ukraine’s Crimea\nTrump Rebukes Putin After Russian Attack on Kyiv\nTrump Blames Zelensky as Ukraine Peace Talks Stumble\nZelensky Pushes Back on U.S. Peace Plan\nUkraine and Russia Had Cease-Fires Before.

December that the army needs 300 tanks to win back territory the. Russians conquered last year, an analysis that. Western military officials agree with. In its statement, the. British government said it would accelerate diplomatic and military support to aid. Ukraine's efforts to push back. Russian forces as the anniversary of the war approaches late next month. \"The. Prime. Minister is clear that a long and static war only serves. Russia's ends,\" the statement said. The initial provision of a small number of advanced tanks won't a big or immediate difference on the battlefield, said. Franz-Stefan. Gady, a fellow with the. International. Institute for. Strategic. Studies in. London. The logistics of setting up supply chains, fuel lines and trained crews for the complex machinery means the. West isn't likely to be able to deliver tanks in the kinds of numbers that would make a significant impact for at least many months to come. Challenger 2 tanks in a. NATO exercise last spring in. Estonia. That said, even providing a few dozen tanks means creating the repair yards and logistical centers that could make it much easier to send the next round of heavy combat vehicles. It signals a lasting commitment to building up. Ukraine's military, countering. Russian. President. Vladimir. Putin's bet that the. West will soon tire of aiding. Ukraine, said. Mr. Gady. \"It will send a clear message that the. West is in for the long haul,\" he said. \"Even for these small numbers of tanks you would need to build up a logistical supply chain. You could slowly build on that.\". There are some 2,000. Leopard 2 tanks held by 13 militaries across. Europe including. Turkey, according to the. European. Council on. Foreign. Relations, a think tank. It notes that global stocks of these tanks are in varying states of readiness. Canada, for example, has an inventory of more than 80, but half are set aside for training purposes. For the moment, the only other country that has made a specific pledge is. Poland, which has offered a companytypically 14 tanks. The. Ukraine. Defense. Contact. Group, which coordinates support for. Ukraine and includes defense ministers and military officials from around the world, is due to meet. Jan 20. Members are expected to discuss how best to support. Kyiv. German. Vice. Chancellor. Robert. Habeck said. Thursday that. Germany shouldn't stand in the way of countries that want to send. Leopards to. Ukraine. Russia's. Embassy in the. U.K. said. Saturday that the tanks are \"unlikely to help the. Armed. Forces of. Ukraine turn the tide on the battlefield, and they will become a legitimate large target for. Russian guns,\" in comments carried news agency. TASS. British officials believe that, as the war in. Ukraine shifts to a new phase, it makes sense to provide the. Ukrainian army with heavy armor, something that was almost inconceivable just a few months ago. Russia is mobilizing personnel to the front lines, such as at the eastern city of. Bakhmut, creating a numerical advantage that could work against. Ukraine. If. Ukraine is to mount a spring counterattack, it needs tanks to clear. Russian lines without incurring huge losses in personnel, according to military analysts. France has pledged to send. AMX-10 armored vehicles to. Ukraine. Moreover, some. British officials feel that the. West needs to more aggressively tilt the advantage in. Ukraine's favor with a larger supply of weapons to quickly help. Ukraine into a position of relative strength from which it can negotiate an end to the war with. Russia. Without this infusion of weaponry, they fear the war could drag on for years. The. British. Army's. Challenger 2 is more than two decades old, but it will still be the most advanced tank the. Ukrainians have fielded in battle. Up until now, most of the heavy armor provided such as. Poland have been old. Soviet-era tanks. The. U.K. has a stock of around 227. Challenger 2 tanks and is in the process of replacing them with a modernized version. Biden administration officials have said they don't object to other countries providing tanks and welcome the. British contribution. Meanwhile, they remain open to providing. U.S. Abrams tanks to. Ukraine but haven't decided to do so, nor do they anticipate that tanks would be announced in the near future, officials said this past week. \"This is something that we absolutely agree that. Ukraine does need tanks,\" said. Laura. Cooper, a top. Pentagon policy official, earlier this month. But the. U.S. remains worried about the training and logistics required to use an. Abrams tank, which. Ms. Cooper said is a \"gas guzzler.\". The. U.S. wants to make sure. Ukrainians can operate and maintain the tanks before the. U.S. provides them, administration officials said. In addition to the. British tanks, the. U.S. and the. Netherlands paid to refurbish. T-72 tanks, which are arriving on the battlefield in. Ukraine this month. Until recent weeks, the issue of tanks was largely taboo. Members of the. North. Atlantic. Treaty. Organization and other allies such as. Australia supplied armored military vehicles that separately have many characteristics of tanks, such as heavy armor, big guns and caterpillar treads, but not all in one system. France recently said it would send. AMX-10s, which have a cannon but are considered light tanks because they have wheels rather than treads. The. U.S. said earlier this month that it plans to send. Bradley. Fighting. Vehicles, which have treads and heavy armor but don't carry a large cannon, as a main battle tank does. Secret. Purges,. Tense. Standoffs. The. War. Over. Household. Clutter.

         "Title: Workers Lose Ground to Inflation Despite Big Wage Gains\n\nAdvertisement\nECONOMY\nJOBS\nWorkers Lose Ground to Inflation Despite Big Wage Gains\nRecent data suggest a shift is under way, with paycheck totals gaining as inflation recedes\nBy\nDavid Harrison\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 14, 2023 5:31 am ET\n185\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(6 min)\nIn the long run, wage increases tend to move alongside inflation, economists say. PHOTO: CHET STRANGE FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nWorker pay increases fell behind inflation in 2022 for the second year in a row, leaving households worse off despite historically strong pay gains. \nBut recent data suggest a shift is under way, with paycheck totals gaining ground as inflation eases. Whether the trend continues in 2023 depends on the path of the economy, which is cooling as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and faces the risk of a recession.\nA historically tight labor market pushed up average hourly earnings by 4.6% in December from a year earlier, the Labor Department said this week, compared with a 6.5% annual inflation rate in the same period. Likewise, average hourly earnings rose 4.9% in December 2021 from a year earlier, compared with a 7% annual inflation rate. \nReal average hourly earnings, change from a year earlier\nSource: Labor Department\nNote: Seasonally adjusted\nCreated with Highcharts 9.0.1\n2017\n'20\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n%\nThe result: Worker pay actually fell the past two years after accounting for inflation. Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings—or real earnings—were down 1.7% in December 2022 from a year earlier, following a 2.1% decline in December 2021. \nIn the long run, wage increases tend to move alongside inflation, economists say. But at times of economic upheaval, such as during the pandemic, the gap between the two can widen.\nDuring the past two years, supply-chain disruptions related to the pandemic and higher energy costs linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused inflation to outpace wage gains. The effect of these supply factors is now fading, putting less pressure on consumer prices.\nBoth pay increases and inflation have been cooling since the middle of last year. But for the past two months inflation has been easing more than wages, giving paychecks a boost.\nAs a result, this could be the year that workers start seeing real wage gains again. \n“The question for 2023 is which moderates faster: inflation or wages,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, a payroll processor.\nOrdinarily, if paychecks aren’t keeping up with inflation, households would be forced to cut back on spending, which could send the economy into a downturn.\nIn this case, households benefited from huge amounts of pent-up savings, thanks to multiple rounds of federal stimulus and reduced spending during the early months of the pandemic. Families tapped into those savings last year to keep up their consumption.\nInflation-adjusted consumer spending either rose or held level every month of last year through November, according to the latest data available, indicating that consumers have yet to pull back.\nAmy Hekman, of Grand Rapids, Mich., lost her job at an early-childhood nonprofit early in the pandemic. But higher unemployment insurance payments included in 2020 pandemic stimulus kept her afloat, she said. \nAmy Hekman, of Grand Rapids, Mich., says a big jump in rent has prompted her to think about a new, more lucrative career. PHOTO: AMY HEKMAN\nHer rent has gone up 30% over three years, “not including groceries, gas and all those other things that have increased as well,” she said, prompting her to think about a new, more lucrative career.\nIn 2021, she started taking on temporary work assignments in human resources, looking to make a career change. Now she is interviewing for full-time human-resources jobs that could allow her to better absorb higher prices.\n“I am only looking for positions that would put me ahead,” she said.\nIn recent months, the savings cushion that Americans have built up has been slowly shrinking. Fed researchers estimated the total amount of excess savings fell to $1.7 trillion midway through 2022, from $2.3 trillion in the third quarter of 2021.\n“As of now, the consumer is still holding up,” said Ms. Richardson. “This is really a race against the clock to restore inflation to more tolerable levels and then let the job market do what it does, which in a tight labor market is keep wages robust. That’s hopefully what happens this year.”\nFed officials have been worried that rising wages and high inflation could feed off each other, causing a spiral. So far, that hasn’t happened. Officials have said they want to see wage increases ease, which could take some pressure off inflation.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s not that we don’t want wage increases,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this past month. “We want strong wage increases.

         "Recent data suggest a shift is under way, with paycheck totals gaining as inflation recedes 185 6 min. In the long run, wage increases tend to move alongside inflation, economists say. Worker pay increases fell behind inflation in for the second year in a row, leaving households worse off despite historically strong pay gains. But recent data suggest a shift is under way, with paycheck totals gaining ground as inflation eases. Whether the trend continues in depends on the path of the economy, which is cooling as the. Federal. Reserve raises interest rates and faces the risk of a recession. A historically tight labor market pushed up average hourly earnings by 4.6 in. December from a year earlier, the. Labor. Department said this week, compared with a 6.5 annual inflation rate in the same period. Likewise, average hourly earnings rose 4.9 in. December from a year earlier, compared with a 7 annual inflation rate. '20 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10. The result. Worker pay actually fell the past two years after accounting for inflation. Inflation-adjusted average hourly earningsor real earningswere down 1.7 in. December from a year earlier, following a 2.1 decline in. December . In the long run, wage increases tend to move alongside inflation, economists say. But at times of economic upheaval, such as during the pandemic, the gap between the two can widen. During the past two years, supply-chain disruptions related to the pandemic and higher energy costs linked to. Russia's invasion of. Ukraine caused inflation to outpace wage gains. The effect of these supply factors is now fading, putting less pressure on consumer prices. Both pay increases and inflation have been cooling since the middle of last year. But for the past two months inflation has been easing more than wages, giving paychecks a boost. As a result, this could be the year that workers start seeing real wage gains again. \"The question for is which moderates faster inflation or wages,\" said. Nela. Richardson, chief economist at. ADP, a payroll processor. Ordinarily, if paychecks aren't keeping up with inflation, households would be forced to cut back on spending, which could send the economy into a downturn. In this case, households benefited from huge amounts of pent-up savings, thanks to multiple rounds of federal stimulus and reduced spending during the early months of the pandemic. Families tapped into those savings last year to keep up their consumption. Inflation-adjusted consumer spending either rose or held level every month of last year through. November, according to the latest data available, indicating that consumers have yet to pull back. Amy. Hekman, of. Grand. Rapids,. Mich., lost her job at an early-childhood nonprofit early in the pandemic. But higher unemployment insurance payments included in pandemic stimulus kept her afloat, she said. Amy. Hekman, of. Grand. Rapids,. Mich., says a big jump in rent has prompted her to think about a new, more lucrative career. Her rent has gone up 30 over three years, \"not including groceries, gas and all those other things that have increased as well,\" she said, prompting her to think about a new, more lucrative career. In , she started taking on temporary work assignments in human resources, looking to make a career change. Now she is interviewing for full-time human-resources jobs that could allow her to better absorb higher prices. \"I am only looking for positions that would put me ahead,\" she said. In recent months, the savings cushion that. Americans have built up has been slowly shrinking. Fed researchers estimated the total amount of excess savings fell to 1.7 trillion midway through , from 2.3 trillion in the third quarter of . \"As of now, the consumer is still holding up,\" said. Ms. Richardson. \"This is really a race against the clock to restore inflation to more tolerable levels and then let the job market do what it does, which in a tight labor market is keep wages robust. That's hopefully what happens this year.\". Fed officials have been worried that rising wages and high inflation could feed off each other, causing a spiral. So far, that hasn't happened. Officials have said they want to see wage increases ease, which could take some pressure off inflation. \"It's not that we don't want wage increases,\". Fed. Chair. Jerome. Powell said this past month. \"We want strong wage increases. We just want them to be at a level that's consistent with 2 inflation.\". Right now, he added, wage gains are \"well above\" that level. Do you feel like your wages are keeping pace with inflation? Join the conversation below. Wages tend to be \"stickier\" than inflation, said. Credit. Suisse economist. Jeremy. Schwartz.

         "Title: VA Expands Efforts to Curb Suicide Among Veterans\n\nAdvertisement\nU.S.\nVA Expands Efforts to Curb Suicide Among Veterans\nImmediate access to treatment, focus on firearms, training for doctors are part of program\nBy\nBen Kesling\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 14, 2023 10:03 am ET\n29\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(7 min)\nThe VA is trying to find ways to address concerns many veterans have about seeking mental-health treatment.  PHOTO: MARK KAUZLARICH FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nVeterans facing a suicide crisis, even those not enrolled in the VA system, can get immediate and free treatment, the Department of Veterans Affairs said Friday, part of a decadelong effort to combat mental-health issues that have long racked the veteran community.\nThe VA has taken a more robust approach to addressing veteran suicide in recent years—especially suicide by firearm, which disproportionately affects the veteran community. VA officials are trying to find ways to address concerns many veterans have about seeking mental-health treatment or discussing their guns and firearms safety. \nMost veterans are now eligible for 30 days of inpatient or 90 days of outpatient care, and the VA said it is streamlining access to private facilities for those deemed to be at imminent risk of self-harm. The change expands eligibility for such services to also include the approximately nine million veterans who aren’t enrolled in the VA system.\nThe VA effort has also included a partnership with the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a major firearms trade group, to bridge political and ideological divisions. Next week, for the first time, the VA will headline part of the NSSF’s shooting, hunting and outdoor trade event known as SHOT Show, the nation’s largest firearms trade show. \nThe check-in desk at a VA outpatient clinic in Portland, Maine. PHOTO: PATRICK OUELLETTE/PORTLAND PRESS HERALD/GETTY IMAGES\nThe renewed push to address veteran suicide-by-firearm began during the Trump administration in 2017 and 2018, said Dr. Matthew Miller, head of suicide prevention for the VA. \n“We sat down at VA and said we need to do something more,” he said in an interview. “We said, ‘Why don’t we do something about the factor that’s involved with 70% of suicides?’ And that’s firearms.”\nVeterans are more likely than civilians to own firearms, and they are more likely to use them for suicide, according to VA statistics. And gun owners can become defensive about any effort to address firearm restrictions, which precluded discussion of preventing firearm suicide in the past, said Ari Freilich, state policy director at Giffords Law Center, which seeks to end gun violence.\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nThe 10-Point\nA personal, guided tour to the best scoops and stories every day in The Wall Street Journal.\nPreview\nSubscribed\n“It’s really important to talk about where we were a decade ago,” he said, with gun companies and lobbyists all but refusing to talk about links between firearm access and suicide. \nSince then, groups such as the NSSF have begun to address the need to talk about firearm suicide. Mr. Freilich said the industry should have talked about these matters long ago, and that it continues to profit off weapons that bring people harm, but it is important to recognize the crucial change that has taken place.\n“We need credible messengers to reach people where they are and trust it,” he said. “That’s such a bedrock of our work.”\nWhile there are political policy debates about ways to address firearms issues through legislation, these disparate groups have tried to find common ground and focus on solutions that can save lives. One such solution is widespread use of gun locks and having gun owners put what is known as time and distance between themselves and firearms and ammunition when possible. That includes storing ammunition separately from weapons and even persuading gun owners to trust someone close to them to safeguard their guns for them when they might be in crisis.\nIn 2016, NSSF joined with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention after gun retailers and members began asking more about the issue, said Dr. Doreen Marshall, vice president of mission engagement for the suicide-prevention organization.\n“NSSF saying, ‘This is important’—it changed the dialogue nationally,” she said.\nThen in 2019, the NSSF joined with the VA to bring the message to veterans.\nRep.

         "U.S. Immediate access to treatment, focus on firearms, training for doctors are part of program 29 7 min. The. VA is trying to find ways to address concerns many veterans have about seeking mental-health treatment. Veterans facing a suicide crisis, even those not enrolled in the. VA system, can get immediate and free treatment, the. Department of. Veterans. Affairs said. Friday, part of a decadelong effort to combat mental-health issues that have long racked the veteran community. The. VA has taken a more robust approach to addressing veteran suicide in recent yearsespecially suicide by firearm, which disproportionately affects the veteran community. VA officials are trying to find ways to address concerns many veterans have about seeking mental-health treatment or discussing their guns and firearms safety. Most veterans are now eligible for 30 days of inpatient or 90 days of outpatient care, and the. VA said it is streamlining access to private facilities for those deemed to be at imminent risk of self-harm. The change expands eligibility for such services to also include the approximately nine million veterans who aren't enrolled in the. VA system. The. VA effort has also included a partnership with the. National. Shooting. Sports. Foundation, a major firearms trade group, to bridge political and ideological divisions. Next week, for the first time, the. VA will headline part of the. NSSF's shooting, hunting and outdoor trade event known as. SHOT. Show, the nation's largest firearms trade show. The check-in desk at a. VA outpatient clinic in. Portland,. Maine. The renewed push to address veteran suicide-by-firearm began during the. Trump administration in and , said. Dr. Matthew. Miller, head of suicide prevention for the. VA. \"We sat down at. VA and said we need to do something more,\" he said in an interview. \"We said, 'Why don't we do something about the factor that's involved with 70 of suicides?'. And that's firearms.\". Veterans are more likely than civilians to own firearms, and they are more likely to use them for suicide, according to. VA statistics. And gun owners can become defensive about any effort to address firearm restrictions, which precluded discussion of preventing firearm suicide in the past, said. Ari. Freilich, state policy director at. Giffords. Law. Center, which seeks to end gun violence. \"It's really important to talk about where we were a decade ago,\" he said, with gun companies and lobbyists all but refusing to talk about links between firearm access and suicide. Since then, groups such as the. NSSF have begun to address the need to talk about firearm said the industry should have talked about these matters long ago, and that it continues to profit off weapons that bring people harm, but it is important to recognize the crucial change that has taken place. \"We need credible messengers to reach people where they are and trust it,\" he said. \"That's such a bedrock of our work.\". While there are political policy debates about ways to address firearms issues through legislation, these disparate groups have tried to find common ground and focus on solutions that can lives. One such solution is widespread use of gun locks and having gun owners put what is known as time and distance between themselves and firearms and ammunition when possible. That includes storing ammunition separately from weapons and even persuading gun owners to trust someone close to them to safeguard their guns for them when they might be in crisis. In ,. NSSF joined with the. American. Foundation for. Suicide. Prevention after gun retailers and members began asking more about the issue, said. Dr. Doreen. Marshall, vice president of mission engagement for the suicide-prevention organization. \"NSSF saying, 'This is important'it changed the dialogue nationally,\" she said. Then in , the. NSSF joined with the. VA to bring the message to veterans. Rep. Chris. Stewart says his work with veterans made him realize the acute crisis that needed to be addressed. \"Organizations like the. VA recognize that we have the ability to reach a community that they might not be able to reach,\" said. Joe. Bartozzi, president and chief executive of the.

PHOTO: KHALED ELFIQI/SHUTTERSTOCK\nDeclining international cooperation and commerce could shrink the global economy, particularly harming low-income countries, the International Monetary Fund said in a new study.\nThe report cited several ways that government policies are driving a reversal of global economic integration, such as by restrictions on trade, immigration and cross-border capital flows. The authors labeled this process geoeconomic fragmentation and warned it could lower global gross domestic product by up to 7% over an unspecified “long-term” period.\nIf technology sharing is also restricted, the losses would be even greater, from 8% to 12%, in some, mostly lower-income and emerging economies, said the staff report, released Sunday.\nThis could undo the economic globalization of recent decades that the IMF said has reduced poverty in developing countries and delivered lower prices to low-income consumers in advanced economies.\n“The global economy may be on the brink of a reversal of the steady increase in integration that characterized the second half of the 20th century,” the multilateral lender said in its analysis. “While fragmentation may entail strategic advantages for some countries in selected cases, it is very likely to involve significant economic costs in the aggregate.”\nThe costs “would include higher import prices, segmented markets, diminished access to technology and to both skilled and unskilled labor, and ultimately reduced productivity which may result in lower living standards,” the IMF said.\nThe IMF concluded that the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine further strained trade ties that were tested by a shallow and uneven recovery from the 2008 financial crisis as well as the U.K.’s exit from the European Union and continuing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.\nThe IMF noted that at the height of the pandemic, countries limited their exports of medical goods and foodstuffs with export bans that accounted for about 90% of trade restrictions.\nMoreover, the war in Ukraine and associated sanctions placed by the West on Russia and Belarus led to “major dislocations in energy and agricultural commodity markets.”\nThe lMF said that the U.S., European Union and China had all enacted recent measures to promote domestic high-tech production. Companies, too, were moving their supply chains to minimize risk, with key words such as “reshoring,” “near-shoring” and “onshoring” appearing more frequently in company earnings calls and reports, the IMF said.\nThis trend toward fragmentation in trade would likely reduce opportunities for emerging economies and slow the reduction of poverty, according to the IMF.\nRising barriers to the flow of labor across borders could also slow down innovation and technological diffusion, the IMF said. Economic fragmentation could also constrict options for international investing, which would hinder development. The trends are likely to lead to uncertainty and to make cooperation on challenges such as climate change more difficult, the lender said.\nFragmentation is likely to contribute to splintered regulation, making some forms of international banking untenable and raising the cost of financing, according to the IMF. Countries that wanted to preserve stability would likely have to rely on “costly self-insurance” such as reducing external debt to bolster themselves against shocks.\nThe IMF recommends ensuring trade cooperation on global public goods and fair competition, while protecting the most vulnerable populations. Further, the lender recommends preserving minimal cooperation through what it calls guardrails, for example, “safe corridors” to enable the movement of critical goods and services.\nIt also recommends that countries try to achieve a small number of common goals in areas where they have broad alignment. “Open a path for rebuilding trust,” the IMF said. One such area could be a new digital international payment system.\nThe report comes amid multiple signs that the global economy slowed toward the end of 2022 under the weight of high inflation and rising interest rates, combined with challenges caused by the war in Ukraine and effects of Covid-19 in China.\nThe World Bank earlier this month sharply lowered its forecast for global economic growth in 2023 and noted an elevated risk of a worldwide recession. The bank expects growth to slow to 1.7% in 2023, down from an estimate of 3% growth in June. That would mark the third-weakest pace of global growth in nearly three decades, overshadowed only by the 2009 and 2020 downturns, according to the World Bank.\n—Greg Ip contributed to this article.\nAdvertisement\nWrite to Daniella Cheslow at daniella.cheslow@wsj.com\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nRECOMMENDED VIDEOS",

IMF said has reduced poverty in developing countries and delivered lower prices to low-income consumers in advanced economies. \"The global economy may be on the brink of a reversal of the steady increase in integration that characterized the second half of the 20th century,\" the multilateral lender said in its analysis. \"While fragmentation may entail strategic advantages for some countries in selected cases, it is very likely to involve significant economic costs in the aggregate.\". The costs \"would include higher import prices, segmented markets, diminished access to technology and to both skilled and unskilled labor, and ultimately reduced productivity which may result in lower living standards,\" the. IMF said. The. IMF concluded that the. Covid-19 pandemic and. Russia's invasion of. Ukraine further strained trade ties that were tested by a shallow and uneven recovery from the financial crisis as well as the. U.K.'s exit from the. European. Union and continuing trade tensions between. Washington and. Beijing. The. IMF noted that at the height of the pandemic, countries limited their exports of medical goods and foodstuffs with export bans that accounted for about 90 of trade restrictions. Moreover, the war in. Ukraine and associated sanctions placed on. Russia and. Belarus led to \"major dislocations in energy and agricultural commodity markets.\". The lMF said that the. U.S.,. European. Union and. China had all enacted recent measures to promote domestic high-tech production. Companies, too, were moving their supply chains to minimize risk, with key words such as \"reshoring,\" \"near-shoring\" and \"onshoring\" appearing more frequently in company earnings calls and reports, the. IMF said. This trend toward fragmentation in trade would likely reduce opportunities for emerging economies and slow the reduction of poverty, according to the. IMF. Rising barriers to the flow of labor across borders could also slow down innovation and technological diffusion, the. IMF said. Economic fragmentation could also constrict options for international investing, which would hinder development. The trends are likely to lead to uncertainty and to make cooperation on challenges such as climate change more difficult, the lender said. Fragmentation is likely to contribute to splintered regulation, making some forms of international banking untenable and raising the cost of financing, according to the. IMF. Countries that wanted to preserve stability would likely have to rely on \"costly self-insurance\" such as reducing external debt to bolster themselves against shocks. The. IMF recommends ensuring trade cooperation on global public goods and fair competition, while protecting the most vulnerable populations. Further, the lender recommends preserving minimal cooperation through what it calls guardrails, for example, \"safe corridors\" to enable the movement of critical goods and services. It also recommends that countries try to achieve a small number of common goals in areas where they have broad alignment. \"Open a path for rebuilding trust,\" the. IMF said. One such area could be a new digital international payment system. The report comes amid multiple signs that the global economy slowed toward the end of under the weight of high inflation and rising interest rates, combined with challenges caused in. Ukraine and effects of. Covid-19 in. China. The. World. Bank earlier this month sharply lowered its forecast for global economic growth in and noted an elevated risk of a worldwide recession. The bank expects growth to slow to 1.7 in , down from an estimate of 3 growth in. June. That would mark the third-weakest pace of global growth in nearly three decades, overshadowed only by the and downturns, according to the. World. Bank. Greg. Ip contributed to this article. Secret.

The White House has called on Congress to raise the debt ceiling without conditions.\n“There’s going to be no negotiation over it.

PHOTO: JUSTIN LANE/SHUTTERSTOCK\nMicrosoft Corp. MSFT 0.24%\nincrease; green up pointing triangle\nsaid Monday that it is allowing more customers access to the software behind popular artificial-intelligence tools made by OpenAI.\nThe startup has been the center of the tech industry’s recent surge in excitement about AI, thanks to its futuristic products such as chatbot ChatGPT, which can answer questions and write essays and poems, and image generator Dall-E 2, which turns language prompts into novel images. \nWhile Microsoft MSFT 0.24%\nincrease; green up pointing triangle\nand OpenAI used to limit the number of businesses that had access to the tools, the Azure OpenAI Service will allow any business to apply for access—opening the way for more AI-infused products.\nMicrosoft CEO on Making More AI Tools Available\nPlay video: Microsoft CEO on Making More AI Tools Available\nSpeaking at WSJ’s Journal House during the 2023 World Economic Forum, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella discusses the company expanding access to OpenAI tools and the growing capabilities of ChatGPT.\nBroadening access to AI tools is the next step in trying to turn the software that has captured the public’s imagination into a potentially big business for Microsoft, OpenAI and others. \nMicrosoft has invested $1 billion in OpenAI and is in talks to put in even more, The Wall Street Journal previously reported\nMicrosoft on Monday said in a blog post it won’t allow customers access to build on ChatGPT at first. Instead, it will be offering access to GPT-3.5, as well as Dall-E 2 and a code–writing tool, Codex, which can turn natural language prompts into code. The company said it plans to make ChatGPT available for businesses in the near future.\nMicrosoft’s vice president of AI platform, Eric Boyd, wrote in the post that the company’s cloud hosting service Azure has been updated for the AI era and, paired with OpenAI’s tools, allows customers to make “cutting-edge applications.” \n“With Azure OpenAI Service now generally available, more businesses can apply for access to the most advanced AI models,” Mr. Boyd wrote.\nOpenAI’s tools such as GPT-3 have already been popular among some startups. Since being made available in a limited fashion in 2020, companies such as content-creation startup Jasper have licensed GPT-3 to create products that can automatically generate text for websites.

The company also provides a delivery guarantee, which provides some compensation to shoppers if their merchandise isn’t delivered on time. \nOrders placed through AliExpress fell in Alibaba’s last three fiscal quarterly reports.

Once one of China’s fastest-growing tech businesses, Alibaba’s revenue for its last two fiscal quarters was little changed from the year-earlier periods as a result of a slowdown in consumer spending during China’s strict zero-Covid policy. The company also swung to a net loss in the July-to-September quarter. \nLast year, Alibaba Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said globalization was one of the company’s three key strategies, along with consumption and cloud computing. Alibaba’s international retail business, which includes AliExpress, contributes only 5% to the company’s total revenue.

         "Title: Global Unemployment to Steady Despite Economic Slowdown, Says International Labour Organization\n\nAdvertisement\nECONOMY\nGLOBAL\nGlobal Unemployment to Steady Despite Economic Slowdown, Says International Labour Organization\nThe U.N. agency sees the first episode of stagflation since the 1970s, but no similar surge in unemployment\nBy\nPaul Hannon\nFollow\nJan. 16, 2023 5:13 am ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(4 min)\nHigh food prices will be a drag on the global economy this year. PHOTO: MICHAEL M. SANTIAGO/GETTY IMAGES\nUnemployment will stay mostly stable around the world this year and next despite a sharp economic slowdown, reflecting a shortage of workers in rich countries among other factors, the International Labour Organization said Monday.  \nHigh prices for food and energy, coupled with rising interest rates, are expected to slow the global economy this year. The World Bank last week said it expects world output to rise by just 1.7%, which would be the third-weakest expansion in nearly three decades, overshadowed only by the 2009 and 2020 downturns. \nThe expected resilience of the labor market despite these conditions underlines a key specificity of the current downturn: Aging populations in a number of economies are making it increasingly hard for businesses to fill their vacancies.\nIn its annual report on the outlook for jobs, the ILO said the global economy faces its first episode of stagflation since the 1970s. But while unemployment rose significantly during that decade of weak growth and high inflation, the United Nations agency expects the number of unemployed workers to rise by just 3 million to 208 million in 2023, leaving the jobless rate unchanged at 5.8%.\nThe report noted that there remain significant numbers of potential workers who are sidelined because of their gender. PHOTO: KIN CHEUNG/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nEven that modest rise will add to the damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, with 13 million more people unemployed in 2022 than in 2019, despite a substantial drop during the year. While unemployment rates have fallen below their prepandemic levels in the Americas and Europe, they remain higher in other regions.\n“The slowdown in global employment growth means that we don’t expect the losses incurred during the Covid-19 crisis to be recovered before 2025,” said Richard Samans, director of the ILO’s research department.\nThe ILO said the fact that unemployment is set to rise only slightly during a significant slowdown in growth is mostly attributable to the slow growth of the global workforce, with more people entering retirement and younger people staying in education for longer. \nCentral banks in the U.S. and Europe worry that shortages of workers will lead to wage rises that could keep inflation high for longer. Policy makers have signaled they intend to raise their key interest rates further this year. The ILO warned they risk going too far if they don’t consider the delayed effects of earlier rate rises and the aggregate impact of their combined moves.  \n“This may be creating an overly tight global macroeconomic environment that will have an unduly severe impact on the real economy and labor markets around the world,” the ILO said. \nRather than losing their jobs, many workers are instead seeing their real wages fall. The ILO said real wages fell 0.9% in 2022, with real wages in rich countries falling by 2.2%, while in developing countries they rose by 0.8%, a slowdown from 2021. \n“This decline is reducing the purchasing power of the middle class and hitting low-income groups particularly hard,” the agency said. \nThe Geneva-based organization estimates that in 2022, 214 million workers were living in extreme poverty, defined as earning less than $1.90 a day, the equivalent of 6.4% of all employed people.  \nIt also noted that there remain significant numbers of potential workers who are sidelined because of their sex. Globally, the labor-force participation rate of women stood at 47.4% in 2022, compared with 72.3% for men. That gap means that for every economically inactive man, there are two such women.\nWrite to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com\nAdvertisement\nInflation and the Economy\nAnalysis from The Wall Street Journal, selected by the editors\nInflation Has Cooled, but Americans Are Still Seething Over Prices\nLower Interest Rates Don’t Guarantee a Soft Landing\nThe American Dream Feels Out of Reach for Most\nInflation's Impact on the Poor vs. the Rich\nAppeared in the January 17, 2023, print edition as 'Global Job Market Seen Resilient'.\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nRECOMMENDED VIDEOS",

Bank last week said it expects world output to rise by just 1.7, which would be the third-weakest expansion in nearly three decades, overshadowed only by the and downturns. The expected resilience of the labor market despite these conditions underlines a key specificity of the current downturn. Aging populations in a number of economies are making it increasingly hard for businesses to fill their vacancies. In its annual report on the outlook for jobs, the. ILO said the global economy faces its first episode of stagflation since the s. But while unemployment rose significantly during that decade of weak growth and high inflation, the. United. Nations agency expects the number of unemployed workers to rise by just 3 million to 208 million in , leaving the jobless rate unchanged at 5.8. The report noted that there remain significant numbers of potential workers who are sidelined because of their gender. Even that modest rise will add to the damage caused -19 pandemic, with 13 million more people unemployed in than in , despite a substantial drop during the year. While unemployment rates have fallen below their prepandemic levels in the. Americas and. Europe, they remain higher in other regions. \"The slowdown in global employment growth means that we don't expect the losses incurred during the. Covid-19 crisis to be recovered before ,\" said. Richard. Samans, director of the. ILO's research department. The. ILO said the fact that unemployment is set to rise only slightly during a significant slowdown in growth is mostly attributable to the slow growth of the global workforce, with more people entering retirement and younger people staying in education for longer. Central banks in the. U.S. and. Europe worry that shortages of workers will lead to wage rises that could keep inflation high for longer. Policy makers have signaled they intend to raise their key interest rates further this year. The. ILO warned they risk going too far if they don't consider the delayed effects of earlier rate rises and the aggregate impact of their combined moves. \"This may be creating an overly tight global macroeconomic environment that will have an unduly severe impact on the real economy and labor markets around the world,\" the. ILO said. Rather than losing their jobs, many workers are instead seeing their real wages fall. The. ILO said real wages fell 0.9 in , with real wages in rich countries falling by 2.2, while in developing countries they rose by 0.8, a slowdown from . \"This decline is reducing the purchasing power of the middle class and hitting low-income groups particularly hard,\" the agency said. The. Geneva-based organization estimates that in , 214 million workers were living in extreme poverty, defined as earning less than 1.90 a day, the equivalent of 6.4 of all employed people. It also noted that there remain significant numbers of potential workers who are sidelined because of their sex. Globally, the labor-force participation rate of women stood at 47.4 in , compared with 72.3 for men. That gap means that for every economically inactive man, there are two such women. Secret.

Chinese officials are moving to try to revitalize their economy and soften their rhetoric toward Washington. The U.S. and Ms. Yellen, meanwhile, are scrutinizing perceived national-security risks in Chinese technology, while also aiming to avoid undue harm to an engine of global economic growth. \n“Secretary Yellen has got a big challenge,” said Matt Goodman, senior vice president for economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. “That’s making the case for growth on one hand and on the other being forceful for the U.S. need to protect our national security.”\nA Treasury official said the department doesn’t view protecting national security and promoting global economic growth to be at odds with each other.

Ms. Yellen, who has pushed for U.S. companies to become less reliant on China, is concerned that China could retaliate against the U.S. economy, according to people familiar with her thinking. If Chinese officials see U.S. policies as too punitive, they could cut off U.S. access to goods such as solar panels, for example. \n“The defense and intelligence agencies are frequently going to have more restrictive views on these questions than the Treasury,” said Mark Sobel, a former Treasury official who is the U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think tank. “Treasury’s macro-analysis well understands there are spillovers and spillbacks and interdependencies, and these are issues that need to be managed for the global economy.”\nChina’s Liu He previously encouraged the U.S. to relax its tariffs on the country’s goods.

PHOTO: ROBERTO E. ROSALES/THE ALBUQUERQUE JOURNAL/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nA former Republican candidate for the New Mexico state legislature was arrested Monday for his suspected involvement in a string of recent drive-by shootings at the homes of several Democratic elected officials.\nSolomon Peña, 39, who lost his race for state representative to his Democratic opponent in November, helped orchestrate the shootings and participated in at least one of them, Albuquerque police said. The homes of two county officials and two state legislators, including the New Mexico House speaker, were hit in the drive-by shootings, according to police. Nobody was hurt in the incidents, which took place over the past several weeks, though the homes sustained damage.\n“We believe he was the mastermind behind this,” said Albuquerque Police chief Harold Medina.\nMr. Peña was upset after losing his race, authorities said, and subsequently paid four other men cash and sent text messages with home addresses where he wanted them to shoot. Following the most recent shooting, which took place on Jan. 3, a car was pulled over in connection to the incident, police said, and two firearms and more than 800 fentanyl pills were seized. The car was owned by Mr. Peña, police said in a news release sent out Monday night.\nPolice said Mr. Peña also went with the men and attempted to shoot at one of the homes, but the AR pistol he was using malfunctioned. One of the other men fired more than a dozen rounds from a separate handgun during that particular shooting, police said.\nEarlier this month, police also arrested another man for his alleged involvement in the incidents.\nAlbuquerque Police chief Harold Medina said police believe the suspect was the mastermind. PHOTO: LIAM DEBONIS/ZUMA PRESS\nPolice said that following his election loss last year, Mr. Peña approached several local lawmakers unannounced at their homes saying he had evidence the election was fraudulent. He grew angry when his entreaties were ignored, they said, and began executing his plan to shoot at the various homes of the Democratic officials.\nIn the news release, police noted that Mr. Peña had been sued by his Democratic opponent in August 2022, who argued that Mr. Peña was ineligible to serve in the state legislature because he is a felon. A judge ruled in September that Mr. Peña could remain on the ballot.\nMr. Peña was in the process of being booked into the Albuquerque jail on Monday night. A lawyer or representative for Mr. Peña couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.\n“APD essentially discovered what we had all feared and what we had suspected: that these shootings were indeed politically motivated,” said Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller, a Democrat.\nAdvertisement\nWrite to Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.com\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nRECOMMENDED VIDEOS",

Monday for his suspected involvement in a string of recent drive- the homes of several. Democratic elected officials. Solomon. Pea, 39, who lost his race for state representative to his. Democratic opponent in. November, helped orchestrate the shootings and participated in at least one of them,. Albuquerque police said. The homes of two county officials and two state legislators, including the. New. Mexico. House speaker, were hit in the drive-by shootings, according to police. Nobody was hurt in the incidents, which took place over the past several weeks, though the homes sustained damage. \"We believe he was the mastermind behind this,\" said. Albuquerque. Police chief. Harold. Medina. Mr. Pea was upset after losing his race, authorities said, and subsequently paid four other men cash and sent messages with home addresses where he wanted them to shoot. Following the most recent shooting, which took place on. Jan. 3, a car was pulled over in connection to the incident, police said, and two firearms and more than 800 fentanyl pills were seized. The car was owned by. Mr. Pea, police said in a news release sent out. Monday night. Police said. Mr. Pea also went with the men and attempted to shoot at one of the homes, but the. AR pistol he was using malfunctioned. One of the other men fired more than a dozen rounds from a separate handgun during that particular shooting, police said. Police said that following his election loss last year,. Mr. Pea approached several local lawmakers unannounced at their homes saying he had evidence the election was fraudulent. He grew angry when his entreaties were ignored, they said, and began executing his plan to shoot at the various homes of the. Democratic officials. In the news release, police noted that. Mr. Pea had been sued opponent in. August , who argued that. Mr. Pea was ineligible to serve in the state legislature because he is a felon. A judge ruled in. September that. Mr. Pea could remain on the ballot. Mr. Pea was in the process of being booked into the. Albuquerque jail on. Monday night. A lawyer or representative for. Mr. Pea couldn't immediately be reached for comment. \"APD essentially discovered what we had all feared and what we had suspected that these shootings were indeed politically motivated,\" said.

The trend accelerated during the pandemic, boosting sales of Scotch, bourbon and tequila, though some recent data has pointed to a slowdown in growth as shoppers look to economize.\nThe deal also comes as distillers have tried to nudge the rum category upmarket by rolling out a growing array of pricey, cask-aged rums with tasting notes meant to be sniffed, swirled and sipped neat.\nDiageo said Don Papa sits in the “superpremium plus” rum category. The company said that the segment was in the early stages of premiumization, with a compound annual growth rate of 18% in Europe and 27% in the U.S. between 2016 and 2021. \nOver that same time, Don Papa outperformed the Europe market, with a compound annual growth rate of 29%, Diageo said. \nDon Papa was launched in 2012 and is now available in 30 countries, with France, Germany and Italy being its largest markets. Diageo said the rum had a unique flavor profile, distinctive packaging and a brand story rooted in the island of Negros Occidental, where the drink is distilled and aged in American oak barrels.\nIn the U.S., Don Papa sells from $37.99 for a 750ml bottle, according to alcohol-delivery site Drizly.

MASON TRINCA FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nBy\nLauren Weber\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 17, 2023 10:39 am ET\n292\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(6 min)\nBusinesses and lawyers are beginning to assess what the Federal Trade Commission’s proposed ban of noncompete clauses in employment contracts could mean for worker mobility, wages and the way future compensation agreements are structured. \nWhile a full or partial ban could expand the pool of potential hires, it also would weaken a tool that employers have come to rely on to retain talent and protect trade secrets and other proprietary information, lawyers say. More companies likely would turn to a patchwork of alternative mechanisms to keep people from leaving and taking valuable information with them, including nondisclosure agreements and employment contracts that reward longevity, they say. \nTHE JOURNAL.\nCould This Be the End of Noncompetes?\n16:36\n1x\nSUBSCRIBE\nAdd to Queue\nExplore Audio Center\n“Employers have operated with an understanding that they can protect their interests through noncompetes,” said Matthew Durham, a Salt Lake City-based attorney with Dorsey & Whitney LLP who advises companies on employment matters. “What you’re seeing, reflected in the FTC proposal and elsewhere, is a growing hostility to the idea that there should be those kinds of restrictions, and it’s changing the environment that employers have been comfortable with in the last number of years.”\nThe FTC proposed a ban this month on nearly all noncompetes, saying that the clauses—which typically prohibit workers from moving to a new employer or starting new ventures of their own—hamper competition in the labor market, suppress wages and hold back innovation and entrepreneurship. The proposal came in response to an executive order from President Biden in 2021.\nBusinesses say they impose noncompete clauses on employees to protect trade secrets and other confidential information, including customer lists and financial data.\nThe FTC contends that noncompete clauses discourage innovation and entrepreneurship. PHOTO: ERIC LEE FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nMr. Durham and others say they believe the FTC may narrow its rule after hearing comments from the public, including employers and business organizations that have already signaled their opposition to the current proposal. The agency could, for example, allow noncompetes for highly compensated workers.\nNoncompetes are common in employment contracts for senior employees like software engineers, sales representatives and top executives. Over time, they have been applied to many parts of the U.S. workforce, including some janitors, baristas, schoolteachers and entry-level workers. According to the FTC, one in five U.S. workers is currently subject to a noncompete clause.\nNoncompetes are regulated at the state level, and many states have already taken action to limit use of the clauses by, in some cases, forbidding employers from imposing them on people earning under a particular wage threshold or for certain types of workers. \n“The vast majority of people in America can’t afford a lawyer to defend a noncompete case,” said Jonathan Pollard, an attorney in Florida who represents workers whose employers are trying to enforce noncompete clauses. “Just the threat of enforcement is often enough to restrain talent in the labor market.”\nThe Federal Trade Commission proposed a new ban on noncompete clauses, which the agency says hurts workers and competition. Companies argue they protect trade secrets. WSJ breaks down what a federal ban could mean for workers and businesses. Photo illustration: Jacob Reynolds\nSome states, such as California and Oklahoma, hold that the clauses are unenforceable in all or nearly all employment contracts. \nA number of studies suggest noncompetes suppress wages and innovation. A review of Oregon’s 2008 ban on noncompetes for hourly workers found that wages rose an average of 2% to 3%. Another study, examining Hawaii’s 2015 ban on noncompete agreements for high-tech workers, found an 11% increase in job moves and a 4% increase in new-hire salaries.\nThe clauses restrain not just pay and entrepreneurship, but also professional development, workers and some attorneys say. \nDaniel Bachhuber had worked as a software consultant for years when he decided to take an in-house job in the fall of 2018. His new employer required that he sign a one-year noncompete agreement, which he said was so broad it would have prevented him from practicing his core skills if he were to leave the company or be fired.\nMr. Bachhuber balked. Earlier in his career, he had been laid off a few weeks into a new job, just after his first child was born. If that happened at the new job, he recalled thinking, he would be unable to earn a living for a year. “I’m always thinking, worst case scenario, what kind of downstream protection do I have?” the 35-year-old said. “Even if I was employed just one day, I couldn’t go back to the same clients I had.”\nDaniel Bachhuber turned down a job after an employer wouldn’t change a noncompete clause. PHOTO: MASON TRINCA FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nHe consulted a lawyer and tried to renegotiate the contract, hoping to salvage a role that would have expanded his skills and given him a chance to work directly with the chief technology officer on special projects. The company declined to change the noncompete clause and, reluctantly, Mr. Bachhuber turned down the position. \nEmployers have other tools to protect information besides noncompete agreements, including nondisclosure agreements, trade secret laws and nonsolicitation agreements, which prohibit workers from poaching customers or employees of their prior firm. \nBut those tools generally can only be used after an employee violates the agreement, said Julie Levinson Werner, who represents employers as a partner with law firm Lowenstein Sandler LLP. “Once someone goes to another company, you’re really on the honor system. You have no way to monitor what information is being disclosed or not,” she said.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nDo you think noncompetes should be banned? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\nObservers on both sides say that limitations on the clauses will compel employers to get more creative about how they retain talent, using everything from compensation to career advancement to keep workers engaged and loyal to the company. Some companies use deferred compensation—such as retention bonuses or rolling stock options that vest after, say, three years—to give people incentives to stay.\n“Do you get better results with honey or vinegar?” said Ms. Werner. “If you want to motivate people and have them happy to stay, you have to look at compensation, the overall environment, how you treat them.”\nThe fate of the FTC’s final rule is up in the air. After a 60-day comment period, the commissioners will consider potential changes to the initial proposal and then issue a final rule. That rule will likely be challenged by business groups or individual companies, and courts will determine its trajectory, attorneys say.\nAdvertisement\nWrite to Lauren Weber at Lauren.Weber@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 18, 2023, print edition as 'Alternatives to Noncompete Clauses Sought'.\nSHOW CONVERSATION (292)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nFurther Reading\nDealmakers Are Struggling to Make Sense of Trump’s Antitrust Policy\nInside Mark Zuckerberg’s Failed Negotiations to End Antitrust Case\nZuckerberg, on Witness Stand, Rebuffs Claims Meta Monopolizes Social-Media Market\nStellantis to Revise Ads Saying Its Cars Are Built in America\nZuckerberg Lobbies Trump to Avoid Meta Antitrust Trial",

He said the airline would continue working toward an agreement at the negotiating table, with mediation scheduled to resume next week.\nMr. Murray said holding a referendum like this is a first for Southwest’s pilots—the culmination of what he said was years of frustration that has bubbled to the surface during a protracted contract negotiation, a rocky re-emergence from the Covid-19 pandemic and in the aftermath of the airline’s recent difficulties recovering from a severe winter storm. \nSouthwest canceled over 16,700 flights late last year after a severe winter storm tipped its operation into chaos, and its pilots have emerged as some of the airline’s harshest critics.\n“This decision is not one based on emotion, but I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t angry,” Mr. Murray wrote Wednesday. “Our airline just suffered a loss of $825 million due to outdated technology and procedures.”\nSouthwest has said that the magnitude of the storm overwhelmed a crew scheduling system the airline uses, leaving it dependent on tedious manual processes that hampered its recovery.\nChief Executive Bob Jordan has acknowledged that the airline made missteps and has said it is taking steps to prevent a recurrence, including working to upgrade a crew scheduling system with new capabilities. It has also hired consultants to review what went wrong—a process Mr. Jordan has said the airline’s unions have been asked to join.\nBest and Worst Airlines of 2022: The Effect of the Southwest Mess\nPlay video: Best and Worst Airlines of 2022: The Effect of the Southwest Mess\nIt was a turbulent year for carriers in 2022.

Illustration: Jon Krause\nU.S. labor laws make airline strikes difficult and rare. The last time U.S. passenger airline pilots went on strike was at Spirit Airlines Inc. in 2010. \nSouthwest’s pilots asked government mediators to step in and oversee their negotiation last year. For a strike to go forward, the National Mediation Board would first have to agree that talks have reached an impasse and would then offer both sides a chance to arbitrate their dispute. If either refused, there would be a 30-day cooling off period. \nWhile any strike could be months away, if it happens at all, the union hinted at the possibility for disruption, writing that it would schedule its vote in May to give Southwest customers more time to plan. \nSouthwest is not alone in facing acrimonious talks with pilots. \nSeveral major carriers have struggled to come to terms with pilot groups in the past year as unions have sought not only better pay but also changes to scheduling practices, protections for time off and other changes they have said are needed to address disruptions the industry faced in its race to meet growing travel demand the past two years.\nPilots at Delta Air Lines Inc.

Southwest's pilotsthe culmination of what he said was years of frustration that has bubbled to the surface during a protracted contract negotiation, a rocky re-emergence from the. Covid-19 pandemic and in the aftermath of the airline's recent difficulties recovering from a severe winter storm. Southwest canceled over 16,700 flights late last year after a severe winter storm tipped its operation into chaos, and its pilots have emerged as some of the airline's harshest critics. \"This decision is not one based on emotion, but. I would be lying if. I said that. I wasn't angry,\". Mr. Murray wrote. Wednesday. \"Our airline just suffered a loss of 825 million due to outdated technology and procedures.\". Southwest has said that the magnitude of the storm overwhelmed a crew scheduling system the airline uses, leaving it dependent on tedious manual processes that hampered its recovery. Chief. Executive. Bob. Jordan has acknowledged that the airline made missteps and has said it is taking steps to prevent a recurrence, including working to upgrade a crew scheduling system with new capabilities. It has also hired consultants to review what went wronga process. Mr. Jordan has said the airline's unions have been asked to join. It was a turbulent year for carriers in . But.

U.S. labor laws make airline strikes difficult and rare. The last time. U.S. passenger airline pilots went on strike was at. Spirit. Airlines. Inc. in . Southwest's pilots asked government mediators to step in and oversee their negotiation last year. For a strike to go forward, the. National. Mediation. Board would first have to agree that talks have reached an impasse and would then offer both sides a chance to arbitrate their dispute. If either refused, there would be a 30-day cooling off period. While any strike could be months away, if it happens at all, the union hinted at the possibility for disruption, writing that it would schedule its vote in. May to give. Southwest customers more time to plan. Southwest is not alone in facing acrimonious talks with pilots. Several major carriers have struggled to come to terms with pilot groups in the past year as unions have sought not only better pay but also changes to scheduling practices, protections for time off and other changes they have said are needed to address disruptions the industry faced in its race to meet growing travel demand the past two years. last year voted overwhelmingly to authorize union leaders to call a strike if they deemed it necessarysimilar to the measure.

Bush and Donald Trump administrations, including as U.S. attorney for Maryland. PHOTO: MICHAEL MCCOY/REUTERS\nWASHINGTON—Weeks after adding the National Football League as a client, former prosecutor Robert Hur received a call from Attorney General Merrick Garland asking him to serve as the special counsel overseeing the investigation into classified documents found at a home and former office of President Biden. It was a request Mr. Hur told associates he didn’t feel he could refuse, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMr. Hur accepted the appointment clear-eyed about the reputational risks of taking on an investigation into a sitting president, according to people familiar with his considerations, especially as a separate special counsel investigates former President Donald Trump over his handling of classified documents found at his South Florida residence and private club, Mar-a-Lago.\nMr. Hur is expected to begin as special counsel at the end of January after winding down his work at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, the law firm he joined as a partner in 2021 after serving as the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Maryland. For Mr. Hur, the appointment entails leaving behind what promised to be a lucrative client in the NFL, which had turned to him to defend against a lawsuit brought by the Washington, D.C., attorney general.\n“This was clearly not a financially motivated decision,” said Rod Rosenstein, who served as deputy attorney general during the Trump administration and assigned Mr. Hur, at the time his top aide, to help oversee Robert Mueller’s special counsel inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. “Rob understands what he is getting into,” Mr. Rosenstein said. \nPresident Biden said Thursday that a “small number” of classified documents from his time as vice president were found at his home and in his personal library. Attorney General Merrick Garland outlined the decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate.

In a statement, Gibson Dunn partner F. Joseph Warin said Mr. Hur “has excelled in every professional endeavor, and we are confident that he will discharge his responsibilities as Special Counsel with the same impeccable judgment and tireless work ethic that he has exhibited throughout his career.”\nIn Mr. Hur, the attorney general picked a Justice Department veteran with experience in the George W. Bush and Trump administrations and political savvy, former colleagues said. During his tenure as U.S. attorney for Maryland, Mr. Hur’s office handled several high-profile cases and secured a conviction against former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh on fraud and tax charges.\nMr. Hur’s return to the Justice Department comes just weeks after he entered his initial court appearance to defend the NFL and its commissioner, Roger Goodell, against a consumer-protection lawsuit alleging that the league and the Washington Commanders team deceived Washington, D.C., residents about their investigation into a “toxic workplace culture that impacted employees, especially women.”\nThe Washington attorney general’s office accuses the league of misleading the public by withholding the full findings of that investigation, which the team initiated before the league took over the inquiry.

That could include more invasive steps such as having the Federal Bureau of Investigation, rather than Mr. Biden’s legal team, search the president’s properties for additional documents, they said. \nAfter the initial discovery of classified documents in November, the Justice Department considered having agents monitor a search by Mr. Biden’s lawyers for the material but decided against it, in part to preserve their freedom to take a tougher line later, including by executing a future search warrant, if negotiations ever turned hostile, people familiar with the matter said.

PHOTO: ANDRE PAIN/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nGermany’s Deutsche Lufthansa AG LHA 1.56%\nincrease; green up pointing triangle\nsaid it had submitted a bid to buy a stake in ITA Airways, the Italian carrier formerly known as Alitalia, in a bet on the continued recovery in air travel.\nLufthansa said Wednesday it was seeking exclusive talks with the Italian government to initially acquire a minority stake in ITA Airways, with an option to buy the remaining shares at a later date. The move comes after a consortium including Air France-KLM Group AF -1.13%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\nand Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL -0.51%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\nfailed to reach a deal to buy a stake in ITA after entering talks last year.\nLufthansa said it wanted to expand in Italy, which it said was its “most important market outside of its home markets and the U.S.,” because of its importance as one of Europe’s biggest economies and most popular vacation destinations.\nThe move comes amid a recovery in international air travel in the wake of the pandemic, with airlines adding routes and expanding capacity to meet rising demand. ITA has ramped up direct flights to Asia, North America and South America, adding routes from its hub in Rome Fiumicino to New Delhi, the Maldives, San Francisco and Rio de Janeiro.\nITA Airways started operations in late 2021 after the collapse of Alitalia, which had been embroiled in special bankruptcy proceedings for years even before the spread of Covid-19. The new airline relaunched with less than half of Alitalia’s aircraft fleet, reducing its network to focus on profitable routes, with the Italian government searching for a new partner or buyer to reduce the state’s control of the carrier.\nITA Airways started operations after the collapse of Alitalia, which had been embroiled in special bankruptcy proceedings. PHOTO: JAE C. HONG/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nAlitalia in its heyday built a reputation for flying Hollywood movie stars and became the official airline of the pope. However, it also struggled to make money—a prospect that has become tougher with rapid expansion in Italy by European low-cost carriers, including Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC, which are undercutting ITA on pricing and costs.\nFor Lufthansa to secure a deal for ITA, it will need to win the support of the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance in talks on how ITA can be integrated into Lufthansa’s operations and network.\n“Acquiring ITA is one of the most challenging propositions in European aviation,” Alex Irving, an equity analyst at Bernstein, said in a note to clients. “The airline has been persistently loss-making, and airlines have invested minority stakes before that have lost their value.”\nA consortium of Air France-KLM, Delta and investment firm Certares Management LLC had secured the right to enter exclusive talks with the Italian government in August last year over plans to privatize ITA Airways.

The streaming company wants a trained flight attendant to be in charge of trips on its super midsize jet, according to the posting on its website. The employee must have outstanding customer service skills and safety training.\nThe pay range for the role is listed as $60,000 to $385,000, depending on the person’s background, according to Netflix. By comparison, the median flight attendant annual salary in 2021 was about $61,000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nNetflix didn’t return requests for comment.\nThe job listing went viral. “Where do I apply?!” was a common refrain. Some social-media users couldn’t believe the wide pay range, a likely effect of new pay-transparency disclosure laws enacted recently in several states including California, where Netflix is based.\nOthers were surprised Netflix was advertising the role at all, as the company has been focused on reining in spending. Last year Netflix posted two consecutive quarters of subscriber losses for the first time in its history and laid off hundreds of employees. But the year ended with what the company called a “brighter finish,” as Netflix beat its own forecast for subscriber gains in the fourth quarter. \nAs interest rates rise and companies tighten their belts, white-collar workers have taken the brunt of layoffs and job cuts, breaking with the usual pattern leading into a downturn. WSJ explains why many professionals are getting the pink slip first. Illustration: Adele Morgan\nFor some flight attendants, the biggest surprise was the potential paycheck. Lauren Pires, a corporate flight attendant based in Miami, said she has never heard of anyone in her industry who has made $385,000.\n“This has to be quite, quite the position to be at this salary,” said Ms. Pires, who has worked on private jets for over a decade. She said a lot of corporate flight attendants make six figures but not as much as the maximum pay on the Netflix listing.\nThe job asks the new hire to balance a highflying life on its Gulfstream G550 jet charter trips with the mundane.\nNetflix’s corporate aircraft services are available to some executives and their families and guests for personal use, according to the company. “Consider amounts related to such travel as a perquisite,” the company’s compensation disclosure says.\nA private jet trip is a common perk at some big companies, often for security reasons.\n“The aviation team helps Netflix reach the world more efficiently and effectively so the company can continue to create joy around the world,” according to the job posting, which noted that the recruit will be based near Netflix’s Silicon Valley headquarters.\nThe flight attendant should be capable of standing for long periods, helping with loading baggage, purchasing and loading aircraft stock before a trip.

Tim Kaine of Virginia, pictured Friday in Richmond, was first elected to the Senate in 2012. PHOTO: JOHN C. CLARK/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said he would run for a third term, providing his party a boost ahead of what is expected to be a tough 2024 campaign to keep control of the chamber. \n“I’m a servant, I love Virginia, I’m proud of what I’ve done, and I’ve got a whole lot more I want to do,” he said at a press conference in Richmond, Va. \nMr. Kaine, 64 years old, served as mayor of Richmond, and later as Virginia’s governor. He was first elected to the Senate in 2012 and won re-election in 2018. His profile was elevated in 2016 when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton chose him to be her vice presidential running mate. \nWhile Virginia is considered a competitive state, Mr. Kaine handily won re-election by a 15-point margin in 2018 against Republican Corey Stewart, a former Prince William County executive. Democrat Joe Biden won the presidential race by 10 points in 2020, but the state elected Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Lt. Gov.

Ms. Sears and state Attorney General Jason Miyares could also look at the Senate or governor race. Some House Republicans could pursue statewide office, such as freshman Rep. Jen Kiggans. \nThe Democratic caucus, which includes three independents who align with the party, currently has a 51-49 majority in the Senate. But Democrats are defending far more seats than Republicans in 2024. Earlier this month, Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D., Mich.) said she won’t seek re-election, potentially easing the way for Republicans to flip that seat.\nDemocrats breathed a sigh of relief that Mr. Kaine was running for another term, after he had held off on committing to another run and as he continues to suffer long-term symptoms from Covid-19. He said party leaders encouraged him to run again.\nHe said that despite the split control of Congress, he could see some progress on immigration laws, mental health and addiction.\n“Is it going to be tougher the next couple of years? Yes, it will be,” he said at his press conference. “But are there meaningful things that can be done and done in a bipartisan way? I believe so,” he said.\nMr. Kaine has been a reliable Democratic vote in the Senate. In his announcement, he touted his work on transportation projects such as highway improvements and the Metro Silver Line in Northern Virginia, as well as his work on foreign affairs and helping military families and veterans.\nIn recent months, he opposed efforts by Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) to push through a provision approving the Mountain Valley Pipeline in West Virginia and Virginia as part of his stalled permitting overhaul proposal. He has worked with Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) on compromise legislation that would codify the rights to abortion recognized in the now-defunct 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and related rulings. Mr. Kaine personally opposes abortion but supports abortion access.\nMr. Kaine is a fluent Spanish speaker, and back in 2016 the Clinton campaign hoped he could help mobilize Latino voters. During his first address as running mate, he switched between English and Spanish and described himself as a progressive, reacting to criticism from the party’s left wing that he was a pro-business centrist who was too open to trade deals. \nMr. Kaine also noted his perfect election record. “I’m 8-0 and I promise you I’m not about to let that change,” he said.

         "Title: ‘Angry Birds’ Owner Gets Takeover Bid From Playtika\n\nAdvertisement\nBUSINESS\nMEDIA\n‘Angry Birds’ Owner Gets Takeover Bid From Playtika\nRovio says it isn’t engaged in deal talks and there was no assurance a deal would be reached\nBy\nTrefor Moss\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 20, 2023 7:12 am ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(4 min)\n‘Angry Birds’ became a hit with gamers when it was launched in 2009. PHOTO: ANNE KAURANEN/REUTERS\nShares in the owner of the “Angry Birds” mobile game franchise soared Friday after it said it had received a 751 million euro takeover proposal, equivalent to $813.5 million, from a rival developer, as a slowdown in the games industry spurs consolidation.\nRovio Entertainment Oyj, which helped pioneer the mobile-gaming industry, said the 9.05 euro-a-share bid from Israel’s Playtika PLTK -0.50%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\nHolding Corp. represented a sweetened offer, following an earlier, undisclosed 8.50 euro bid from the company.\nThe Finnish company said it wasn’t presently engaged in talks with Playtika but would evaluate the proposal and determine how to proceed. Rovio’s shares jumped 40% in early trading to 7.96 euros, before falling back slightly.\nPlaytika specializes in casino-style mobile games, though it has recently added casual games akin to “Angry Birds” to its stable through a series of acquisitions.\nIn a statement, Playtika said it believed the combination of Rovio’s intellectual property and user base, together with its monetization and game operation capabilities, would create value for shareholders.\nSimple yet addictive, “Angry Birds” was a trailblazing mobile game released in 2009 when smartphones and the mobile-gaming industry they enabled were still in their infancy. Players use a slingshot to fire their birds over, under and through various obstacles to knock out squadrons of green pigs attempting to steal their eggs.\nThe title was the first mobile game to be downloaded 1 billion times, according to Rovio, which claimed last year to have reached the milestone of 5 billion downloads across its games catalog.\nRovio has built on the success of the original game by launching multiple sequels, as well as TV spin offs and a 2016 movie. It floated on the stock market in late 2017, hoping the listing would help its growth plans.\nHowever, Rovio has never managed to replicate the success of “Angry Birds” with its subsequent games titles and the aging franchise, while still popular, has itself been eclipsed in recent years by newer rivals.\nEven so, Rovio had a relatively strong 2022, reporting a 16% increase in revenues to 241 million euros in the first nine months of the year relative to the same period in 2021. Profits during the period were up 9% to 33 million euros, the company said.\nPlaytika’s move for Rovio comes amid a postpandemic slowdown in gaming. Revenues from mobile games declined 6.4% year-over-year to $92.2 billion in 2022, according to games industry data provider Newzoo. Mobile games account for half of all videogame revenues, and are worth as much as console, PC and online videogames combined, according to Newzoo.\nThe slowdown has helped drive a wave of consolidation in the industry, most notably in Microsoft Corp.’s proposed $75 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc.  \nPlaytika announced in December that it was laying off around 600 employees, equivalent to 15% of its total head count.\nDominic Chopping contributed to this article.\nAdvertisement\nWrite to Trefor Moss at Trefor.Moss@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 21, 2023, print edition as '‘Angry Birds’ Owner Rovio Receives Takeover Proposal'.\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nThey Paid $3,500 for Apple’s Vision Pro.

Entertainment. Oyj, which helped pioneer the mobile-gaming industry, said the 9.05 euro-a- bid from. Israel's. Playtika. PLTK -0.50. The. Finnish company said it wasn't presently engaged in talks with. Playtika but would evaluate the proposal and determine how to proceed. Rovio's shares jumped 40 in early trading to 7.96 euros, before falling back slightly. Playtika specializes in casino-style mobile games, though it has recently added casual games akin to \"Angry. Birds\" to its stable through a series of acquisitions. In a statement,. Playtika said it believed the combination of. Rovio's intellectual property and user base, together with its monetization and game operation capabilities, would create value for shareholders. Simple yet addictive, \"Angry. Birds\" was a trailblazing mobile game released in when smartphones and the mobile-gaming industry they enabled were still in their infancy. Players use a slingshot to fire their birds over, under and through various obstacles to knock out squadrons of green pigs attempting to steal their eggs. The title was the first mobile game to be downloaded 1 billion times, according to. Rovio, which claimed last year to have reached the milestone of 5 billion downloads across its games catalog. Rovio has built on the success of the original game sequels, as well as. TV spin offs and a movie. It floated on the stock market in late , hoping the listing would help its growth plans. However,. Rovio has never managed to replicate the success of \"Angry. Birds\" with its subsequent games titles and the aging franchise, while still popular, has itself been eclipsed in recent years . Even so,. Rovio had a relatively strong , reporting a 16 increase in revenues to 241 million euros in the first nine months of the year relative to the same period in . Profits during the period were up 9 to 33 million euros, the company said. Playtika's move for. Rovio comes amid a postpandemic slowdown in gaming. Revenues from mobile games declined 6.4 year-over-year to 92.2 billion in , according to games industry data provider. Newzoo. Mobile games account for half of all videogame revenues, and are worth as much as console,. PC and online videogames combined, according to. Newzoo. The slowdown has helped drive a wave of consolidation in the industry, most notably in. Microsoft. Corp.'s proposed 75 billion acquisition of. Activision. Blizzard. Inc. They. Paid 3,500 for.

Lively told those customers to use a different device to contact 911 in the case of an emergency.\n“Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our customers, and as soon as we learned about the issue, we worked to notify customers that were potentially impacted,” Best Buy said. \nAfter discovering service problems, Ms. Kurtz said she and her mother thought there was an issue with the phone battery or the bill not being paid. After a few days, she said she called Lively and got a recorded message about the Jitterbug phone issue. She ordered a new phone for her mother and is switching her to another wireless provider, she said. \nFamily members of Lively customers said the company has offered new phones free in some instances, or discounts on purchasing upgraded devices. \nLast year, all three major U.S. cellular carriers shut down their older 3G networks to free up more wireless spectrum for the build-out of 5G. The majority of U.S. cellphone users have access to 4G or 5G networks, though some older models continued to depend on 3G right up until carriers shut down those networks. Apple Inc.’s iPhone 4S, released more than a decade ago, was the last one the company produced that solely connected on 3G or older networks.\nBest Buy acquired Lively, formerly named GreatCall, in 2018 for $800 million in cash. The service at that time had 900,000 paying subscribers and offered “easy-to-use mobile products and connected devices tailored for aging consumers.” \nLively is known as a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, which buys wholesale access to a wireless network instead of owning and operating it. For major wireless carriers, such arrangements let them sell excess capacity on their networks and gain customers without having to bear the costs of marketing to them or signing them up.\nCarriers generally don’t discuss wholesale agreements or even acknowledge which services run on their networks. Lively’s marketing materials say it is powered by “the nation’s most reliable wireless network,” language that Verizon used in its own wireless marketing for years. \nVerizon initially planned to shut down its 3G network in 2019 but extended the deadline until just before the calendar turned to 2023, months after rivals closed similar systems. Some trade groups petitioned carriers to delay network shutdowns amid concerns of impacts for certain equipment such as security and medical alert systems and phone service for Americans. \nThe extension was “an effort to minimize potential service disruptions and provide additional time for our customers to transition to newer and more advanced technologies and devices,” a Verizon spokesman said. “We’ve had no significant network issues related to this transition and shutdown.”\nA spokesman for the Federal Communications Commission declined to comment on the Lively situation. The FCC has issued consumer warnings about the 3G shutdown and advised users to contact their mobile carrier ahead of time to determine whether service could be impacted.\nSome Jitterbug users were unaware of any coming changes to service related to 3G network shutdowns, according to their family members.\nDena Bisnette of Newton, Kan., said she had heard last year about the shutdown of the 3G network, and called Lively to ask if it would affect her Jitterbug flip phone. A company representative told her the flip phone could be reprogrammed for 4G, she said, but her phone stopped working last week. Ms. Bisnette said she ordered an upgraded Jitterbug Flip2 phone.\nFor 96-year-old Marjorie Rees, her Jitterbug flip phone is how she reaches loved ones from her retirement community, which doesn’t provide landline service for residents, one of her family members said.\n“I’m really at wits end, her phone just goes directly to voice mail when you call,” said her son Christopher Rees, 58, of Fredericksburg, Texas. He has tried Lively customer service, but they gave him similar information that is posted on the website and no explanation of the problem or how to fix it. \n“She is agitated and worried that she is going to miss a phone call,” he said. “For my mom’s sake, I’ve got to get her a new phone.”\nEarlier: In February 2022, U.S. cellular carriers began shutting down 3G.

PHOTO: ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nThe Biden administration on Tuesday released a detailed plan that will make it easier for student-loan holders to wipe out their debts using income-driven repayment plans.\nThe proposed rule from the Education Department is a key step in overhauling the $1.6 trillion federal loan program that has left millions with ballooning debts. The administration first announced the change in August when it unveiled its plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt for qualifying borrowers. The Supreme Court plans next month to take up a challenge to that broader debt-forgiveness, which is frozen after being blocked by lower courts.\nYOUR MONEY BRIEFING\nNew Student-Debt Plan Would Benefit Lower-Income Borrowers\n07:44\n1x\nSUBSCRIBE\nAdd to Queue\nExplore Audio Center\nIncome-driven repayment plans were designed to help lower earners borrow for college, but few have been able to use them effectively because of technical problems and onerous amounts of income-verification paperwork. If enacted, the proposed changes would provide qualifying borrowers with significantly more-generous options that could leave them debt-free sooner, while paying off only a fraction of their total loan balances. \nTo prevent student-debt balances from ballooning in the future, the administration plans to halve, to 5% from 10%, the amount of discretionary income borrowers must pay each month on their undergraduate loans if they are enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan. Borrowers with incomes below 225% of the federal poverty line wouldn’t have to make monthly payments on their loans. The administration estimated that that level corresponds to an individual income of less than roughly $30,600 annually or any borrower in a family of four who makes less than about $62,400 a year.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat do you think of the Biden Administration’s plan to overhaul income-driven repayment programs for student loans? Join the conversation below.\nBorrower loan balances won’t grow as long as they make their monthly payments, even if a low-income borrower’s monthly requirement is set at $0. The change would also forgive loan balances for people enrolled in income-based plans after 10 years of payments, down from 20 under many of the current options, for borrowers whose original loan balances were $12,000 or less.\n“We are, for the first time, creating a student-loan safety net in this country,” said Education Department Undersecretary James Kvaal.\nThe proposed rule now must go through a 30-day public-comment period, after which the department can release a final rule.\nBorrowers and members of both parties in Congress have criticized the existing income-driven repayment program as broken. A government watchdog report last year found that only 157 borrowers out of eight million enrolled in the program successfully had their debt forgiven after decades of payments. The program has existed since 1992.\nIn its regulatory notice, the administration acknowledged that the plan would lead to “increased costs of the student loan programs to the taxpayers in the form of transfers to borrowers who would pay less on their loans.” Some opponents of debt relief, including congressional Republicans, have criticized that arrangement as unfair to taxpayers who didn’t take out loans or who paid them off in full.\nPayment-plan changes could, over time, be nearly as costly as the mass debt-cancellation plan is projected to be. A University of Pennsylvania Wharton School model suggested a range of possible price tags for the changes to income-driven repayment ranging from around $70 billion over 10 years to $450 billion over a longer period, depending on enrollment, and whether colleges continue to raise costs. \nThe shortened repayment period for borrowers with less than $12,000 in debt could make some degree-granting programs, especially at community colleges, effectively free, according to some analysts. A Biden plan to provide free community college was nixed in spending talks with congressional Democrats. \nMany borrowers already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will be closer to debt forgiveness under changes announced by the Biden administration last year. PHOTO: SAUL LOEB/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\n“Based on how much typical community-college students pay for college and earn after graduation, it would allow a great many of them to be payment-free for 10 years, or close to it,” wrote Kevin Carey, a higher-education expert at the nonpartisan New America Foundation, in a December analysis of the income-driven repayment plan based on the details the administration released last year. \nAccording to a fact sheet released Tuesday, the Department estimates that 85% of community-college borrowers would be debt free within 10 years of entering repayment.\nTo cut down on the paperwork that discourages many borrowers from signing up or remaining enrolled in payment programs, the administration aims to automate much of the process, in part by working with the Internal Revenue Service to verify borrower incomes each year.\nMany borrowers already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will be closer to debt forgiveness under changes announced by the administration last year. Borrowers who went into forbearance—a temporary payment freeze where interest continues to build up—for at least 36 months between July 2009 and March 2020 will receive at least three years of payment credit when payments resume later this year. \nThe Education Department said it would fix a longstanding problem where loan payments made to different servicers weren’t counted together, which can lead to undercounting of payments that qualify for eventual forgiveness. Those changes are likely to affect around 3.6 million borrowers, or nearly 10% of all holders of federal student loans.\nPayments and interest accrual on federal student loans have been frozen since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. They are now scheduled to resume 60 days after litigation over the loan-forgiveness program is resolved or the program is implemented.\nAdvertisement\nWrite to Gabriel T.

Court plans next month to take up a challenge to that broader debt-forgiveness, which is frozen after being blocked . New. Student-Debt. Plan. Would. Benefit. Lower-Income. Borrowers 0744 1x. Income-driven repayment plans were designed to help lower earners borrow for college, but few have been able to use them effectively because of technical problems and onerous amounts of income-verification paperwork. If enacted, the proposed changes would provide qualifying borrowers with significantly more-generous options that could leave them debt-free sooner, while paying off only a fraction of their total loan balances. To prevent student-debt balances from ballooning in the future, the administration plans to halve, to 5 from 10, the amount of discretionary income borrowers must pay each month on their undergraduate loans if they are enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan. Borrowers with incomes below 225 of the federal poverty line wouldn't have to make monthly payments on their loans. The administration estimated that that level corresponds to an individual income of less than roughly 30,600 annually or any borrower in a family of four who makes less than about 62,400 a year. What do you think of the. Biden. Administration's plan to overhaul income-driven repayment programs for student loans? Join the conversation below. Borrower loan balances won't grow as long as they make their monthly payments, even if a low-income borrower's monthly requirement is set at 0. The change would also forgive loan balances for people enrolled in income-based plans after 10 years of payments, down from 20 under many of the current options, for borrowers whose original loan balances were 12,000 or less. \"We are, for the first time, creating a student-loan safety net in this country,\" said. Education. Department. Undersecretary. James. Kvaal. The proposed rule now must go through a 30-day public-comment period, after which the department can release a final rule. Borrowers and members of both parties in. Congress have criticized the existing income-driven repayment program as broken. A government watchdog report last year found that only 157 borrowers out of eight million enrolled in the program successfully had their debt forgiven after decades of payments. The program has existed since . In its regulatory notice, the administration acknowledged that the plan would lead to \"increased costs of the student loan programs to the taxpayers in the form of transfers to borrowers who would pay less on their loans.\". Some opponents of debt relief, including congressional. Republicans, have criticized that arrangement as unfair to taxpayers who didn't take out loans or who paid them off in full. Payment-plan changes could, over time, be nearly as costly as the mass debt-cancellation plan is projected to be. A. University of. Pennsylvania. Wharton. School model suggested a range of possible price tags for the changes to income-driven repayment ranging from around 70 billion over 10 years to 450 billion over a longer period, depending on enrollment, and whether colleges continue to raise costs. The shortened repayment period for borrowers with less than 12,000 in debt could make some degree-granting programs, especially at community colleges, effectively free, according to some analysts. A. Biden plan to provide free community college was nixed in spending talks with congressional. Democrats. Many borrowers already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will be closer to debt forgiveness under changes announced administration last year. \"Based on how much typical community-college students pay for college and earn after graduation, it would allow a great many of them to be payment-free for 10 years, or close to it,\" wrote. Kevin. Carey, a higher-education expert at the nonpartisan. New. America. Foundation, in a. December analysis of the income-driven repayment plan based on the details the administration released last year. According to a fact sheet released. Tuesday, the. Department estimates that 85 of community-college borrowers would be debt free within 10 years of entering repayment. To cut down on the paperwork that discourages many borrowers from signing up or remaining enrolled in payment programs, the administration aims to automate much of the process, in part the. Internal. Revenue. Service to verify borrower incomes each year. Many borrowers already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will be closer to debt forgiveness under changes announced last year. Borrowers who went into forbearancea temporary payment freeze where interest continues to build upfor at least 36 months between. July and. March will receive at least three years of payment credit when payments resume later this year. The. Education. Department said it would fix a longstanding problem where loan payments made to different servicers weren't counted together, which can lead to undercounting of payments that qualify for eventual forgiveness. Those changes are likely to affect around 3.6 million borrowers, or nearly 10 of all holders of federal student loans. Payments and interest accrual on federal student loans have been frozen since the start of the pandemic in. March . They are now scheduled to resume 60 days after litigation over the loan-forgiveness program is resolved or the program is implemented. The. U.S. Nuclear. Base. Hidden. Under. Greenland's. Ice for.

Photo: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\nWASHINGTON—Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday named Robert Hur, a former U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, as special counsel to examine why classified documents were found at President Biden’s home and office, intensifying scrutiny of Mr. Biden’s actions after he left the vice presidency in 2017.\nThe appointment came after Mr. Biden’s lawyer said aides found classified records, likely dating from Mr. Biden’s time as vice president, at his Wilmington, Del., garage and at an office he used at a Washington-based think tank that bears his name. It heightens political pressure on the White House and sets up the unusual prospect of three concurrent Justice Department special counsels, two of whom are investigating the actions of the president or his chief rival for office. Lawmakers from both parties in Congress have also demanded details on the discovery of the documents.\nAsk WSJ\nWhat's Next for the GOP?\nThe recent House speakership battle could reflect a larger conflict within the Republican party over its electoral and governing strategy moving forward.

But under the regulations, the extraordinary circumstances here require the appointment of a special counsel for this matter,” Mr. Garland said, adding that he would ensure Mr. Hur got the resources he needed to conduct the probe. \nMr. Hur is a longtime federal prosecutor who was the U.S. attorney in Maryland during the Trump administration and a senior aide to the deputy attorney general. He clerked for the late U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist and prosecuted dozens of financial fraud, public corruption and other cases. He most recently was a defense lawyer in private practice. \nIn a brief order, Mr. Garland said Mr. Hur would examine the possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents found at Mr. Biden’s home and the think tank. “The Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,” the order said.    \n“I will conduct the assigned investigation with fair, impartial and dispassionate judgment,” Mr. Hur said in a statement, adding that he intended to “follow the facts swiftly and thoroughly without fear or favor.”\nMr. Hur’s work will be similar to that of another special counsel, Jack Smith, a longtime public-corruption and international prosecutor, who is running an investigation into former President Donald Trump’s potential mishandling of classified records and other matters. \nRobert Hur served as the U.S. attorney in Maryland in the Trump administration.

The president’s team conducted a search for any further documents, which was completed on Wednesday, Mr. Sauber said.  \nThe National Archives’s inspector general notified a Justice Department prosecutor on Nov. 4 that documents with classified markings had been discovered at the center, where they weren’t authorized to be, Mr. Garland said, offering the fullest timeline yet of the discovery. The FBI on Nov. 9 began assessing whether classified material had been mishandled in violation of federal law, and on Nov. 14, Mr. Garland tasked the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Chicago, John Lausch, with reviewing the documents.\nFive weeks later, on Dec. 20, Mr. Biden’s lawyers told Mr. Lausch that additional documents with classified markings dating to Mr. Biden’s time in the Obama administration had been discovered in the garage of Mr. Biden’s home in Wilmington, prompting the FBI to go there and retrieve them.\nThursday morning, Mr. Biden’s lawyer told Mr. Lausch that an additional document bearing classification markings was identified at the president’s home in Wilmington.\nMr. Lausch on Jan. 5 told Mr. Garland he believed further investigation by a special counsel was warranted, but that he couldn’t do that task himself because he intended to leave the department.\nResponding to repeated questioning Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said officials didn’t disclose additional documents sooner because the search and the Justice Department’s process were still ongoing. She also wouldn’t say what sparked the initial search for documents, and reiterated that Mr. Biden didn’t know what was in them.\nAdvertisement\nThe appointment of Mr. Hur adds a third special counsel to the Garland era at the Justice Department, which he has tried to insulate from partisan influence, appointing outside prosecutors even as he has attested to the department’s vaunted independence from political pressure.\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said the extraordinary circumstances required the special counsel’s appointment.

Mr. Weiss isn’t a special counsel but while other Trump U.S. attorneys left at the start of the administration, Mr. Garland kept Mr. Weiss on to similarly avoid the appearance of a conflict.\nWhile Mr. Garland and other senior Justice Department officials will be regularly briefed on the Biden documents investigation, any move to overrule a major decision by Mr. Hur would require them to notify Congress and explain their reasoning, per the special counsel regulations.\nAsked about the discovery of the latest batch of documents on Thursday, Mr. Biden said the documents had been in a locked garage with his Corvette sports car. “It’s not like they’re sitting out in the street,” he said. \nAfter reading language similar to his lawyer’s statement from the podium, the president said, “We’re going to see all this unfold,” adding, “I’m confident.”\nAsked if any countries had expressed concerns about the security of classified documents, John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said during a White House briefing Thursday: “I’m not aware of any such discussions or concerns.”\nRep.

PHOTO: AMIR HAMJA FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nA federal labor official has upheld the unionization of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -3.16%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\nworkers in Staten Island, N.Y., rejecting an appeal by the e-commerce giant, which tried to challenge last year’s vote to organize. \nCornele Overstreet, a regional director with the National Labor Relations Board who has overseen the case, ruled on Wednesday that Amazon hadn’t provided sufficient evidence to overturn the election results, according to an NLRB spokeswoman. \nThe company has said the union intimidated employees and used other inappropriate methods to sway voters. Workers from the Staten Island warehouse voted to form the company’s first U.S. union last April. \nIn a written statement, an Amazon spokeswoman said the company will appeal the decision, and that it doesn’t believe the election process “was fair, legitimate, or representative of the majority of what our team wants.”\nChris Smalls, president of the union, named Amazon Labor Union, said in a tweet that the time has come for Amazon to sign a union contract with workers.\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWhat’s News\nCatch up on the headlines, understand the news and make better decisions, free in your inbox daily. Enjoy a free article in every edition.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nIn his ruling, Mr. Overstreet said he agreed with a recommendation from of a hearing officer in September who said the company hadn’t met the burden of proof required to overturn election results or have the vote to be held again. Amazon and union organizers participated in a weekslong testimony about the election before the hearing officer’s recommendation. Mr. Overstreet’s ruling means Amazon must start to bargain with the union over a contract, the NLRB spokeswoman said.  \nAmazon has said both the union and NLRB regional office that oversaw the vote created an unfair playing field for the election. It has said union organizers threatened employees to vote in favor of the union, trespassed on its property and took other questionable actions to influence the voting. It also took issue with legal actions the NLRB made against the company during the election that accused it of unlawfully firing a Staten Island worker. The Staten Island election case moved to a different NLRB region after Amazon’s appeal. \nAmazon Labor Union has previously said Amazon’s appeal was a stalling tactic to avoid bargaining with workers on a contract. Mr. Overstreet’s ruling against Amazon means the union is certified as the representative for workers at the Staten Island warehouse. \nAmazon can contest Mr. Overstreet’s ruling to the NLRB governing board in Washington, D.C. The company could eventually bring the case to court, labor attorneys say. Andy Jassy, Amazon’s chief executive officer, last year said he believed the case is “going to take a long time to play out.” \nThe vote to establish the first union inside Amazon in the U.S. provided a watershed moment for labor activists who had long targeted Amazon as a company ripe for organizing. \nThe union has had more difficulty organizing outside of Staten Island, as Amazon spent millions countering its efforts. The Amazon Labor Union lost in two other elections in New York state. A majority of workers at a company site in Bessemer, Ala., also voted against unionizing. \nWorkers have continued to protest against the company, with employees at several facilities striking in recent months.

         "4 min. Workers from. Amazon's. Staten. Island warehouse voted to form a union last. April. workers in. Staten. Island,. N.Y., rejecting an appeal by the e-commerce giant, which tried to challenge last year's vote to organize. Cornele. Overstreet, a regional director with the. National. Labor. Relations. Board who has overseen the case, ruled on. Wednesday that. Amazon hadn't provided sufficient evidence to overturn the election results, according to an. NLRB spokeswoman. The company has said the union intimidated employees and used other inappropriate methods to sway voters. Workers from the. Staten. Island warehouse voted to form the company's first. U.S. union last. April. In a written statement, an. Amazon spokeswoman said the company will appeal the decision, and that it doesn't believe the election process \"was fair, legitimate, or representative of the majority of what our team wants.\". Chris. Smalls, president of the union, named. Amazon. Labor. Union, said in a tweet that the time has come for. Amazon to sign a union contract with workers. In his ruling,. Mr. Overstreet said he agreed with a recommendation from of a hearing officer in. September who said the company hadn't met the burden of proof required to overturn election results or have the vote to be held again. Amazon and union organizers participated in a weekslong testimony about the election before the hearing officer's 's ruling means. Amazon must start to bargain with the union over a contract, the. NLRB spokeswoman said. Amazon has said both the union and. NLRB regional office that oversaw the vote created an unfair playing field for the election. It has said union organizers threatened employees to vote in favor of the union, trespassed on its property and took other questionable actions to influence the voting. It also took issue with legal actions the. NLRB made against the company during the election that accused it of unlawfully firing a. Staten. Island worker. The. Staten. Island election case moved to a different. NLRB region after. Amazon's appeal. Amazon. Labor. Union has previously said. Amazon's appeal was a stalling tactic to avoid bargaining with workers on a 's ruling against. Amazon means the union is certified as the representative for workers at the. Staten. Island warehouse. Amazon can contest. Mr. Overstreet's ruling to the. NLRB governing board in. Washington,. D.C. The company could eventually bring the case to court, labor attorneys say. Andy. Jassy,. Amazon's chief executive officer, last year said he believed the case is \"going to take a long time to play out.\". The vote to establish the first union inside. Amazon in the. U.S. provided a watershed moment for labor activists who had long targeted. Amazon as a company ripe for organizing. The union has had more difficulty organizing outside of. Staten. Island, as. Amazon spent millions countering its efforts. The. Amazon. Labor. Union lost in two other elections in. New. York state. A majority of workers at a company site in. Bessemer,. Ala., also voted against unionizing. Workers have continued to protest against the company, with employees at several facilities striking in recent months. In. November, a federal judge ordered.

ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP/GETTY IMAGES\nBy\nKen Thomas\nFollow\nand\nSabrina Siddiqui\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 13, 2023 5:52 pm ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(8 min)\nWASHINGTON—President Biden’s departure from the White House in January 2017 involved a rush to pack up documents and other belongings, former aides said, as the then-vice president embarked on an intense stretch of domestic and international travel and a series of official events.\nDuring those final weeks, staff members were tasked with packing up Mr. Biden’s West Wing office, where he did much of his work, along with his larger office space at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building near the White House and his residence at the Naval Observatory.\nThat push to close down Mr. Biden’s eight years as vice president has come under intense scrutiny with the recent revelations that classified documents from that period were recently found at a Washington office used by Mr. Biden, and later inside a garage in his home in Wilmington, Del., according to a lawyer for the president. \nMuch remains unknown about how the documents came to be in those places or who put them there, and the White House has declined to provide detailed answers. But the revelations have raised concerns about Mr. Biden’s handling of the nation’s secrets and put the White House on the defensive over the manner in which they disclosed to the public the scope of the mishandled classified documents. \nThe White House said aides had found “a small number” of documents with classified markings at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, Mr. Biden’s post-vice presidential think tank, on Nov. 2, six days before the midterm elections, and turned them over to the National Archives. \nThe White House also said that on Dec. 20, Mr. Biden’s lawyers informed the Justice Department that additional documents with classified markings dating back to Mr. Biden’s time as vice president had been discovered in the garage of Mr. Biden’s home in Wilmington, near his 1967 Corvette Stingray. That prompted the FBI to retrieve the material. On Thursday morning, Mr. Biden’s lawyer informed the government that an additional document bearing classified markings was identified at the president’s home in Wilmington.\nOn Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland named Robert Hur, a former U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, as special counsel to examine the classified documents case.\nBiden ‘Cooperating Fully’ With DOJ as Garland Appoints Special Counsel\nPlay video: Biden ‘Cooperating Fully’ With DOJ as Garland Appoints Special Counsel\nPresident Biden said Thursday a “small number” of classified documents from his time as vice president were found at his home and in his personal library.

The president, during a news conference Tuesday that capped off a visit to Mexico, said he was surprised by the discovery and was cooperating on the matter. \nMr. Biden’s lawyer, Richard Sauber, has said the White House is confident that the Justice Department review “will show that these documents were inadvertently misplaced, and the president and his lawyers acted promptly upon discovery of this mistake.”\nRepublicans have accused the Justice Department of maintaining a double standard on the issue of retention of classified documents because it obtained a warrant to search the Florida home of former President Donald Trump over his holding of top secret documents as part of a criminal investigation. \nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWSJ Politics & Policy\nScoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nThe Justice Department has indicated that part of its investigation includes potential obstruction, after the issue was referred to prosecutors by the National Archives following months of negotiations with Mr. Trump’s lawyers. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and described the investigation as a witch hunt. \nSome of President Biden’s current advisers worked with him during his final days as vice president, including counselor Steve Ricchetti, who was Mr. Biden’s last vice presidential chief of staff, communications director Kate Bedingfield, who held the same position from 2015 to 2017, and chief speechwriter Vinay Reddy. The White House has referred questions about the documents to the Justice Department, which declined to comment.\nFormer aides said the vice president’s general counsel’s office oversaw the documents retention process. Mr. Biden’s executive assistant at the time, Kathy Chung, was most heavily involved in the packing up of the office, according to former aides, but was helped by other lower-level staff members.\nMs. Chung, who now serves as deputy director of protocol for Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, was interviewed by federal investigators late last year about the discovered documents, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Pentagon on Friday declined to make Ms. Chung available for comment and referred calls to the Justice Department, which declined to comment. \nThe Washington, D.C., office building that houses the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, Mr. Biden’s post-vice presidential think tank, where aides discovered ‘a small number’ of classified documents last year.

That busy travel schedule created new documents and papers up until the final day and complicated the packing process, they said. With many senior staff members on the road with Mr. Biden, some aides described a depleted staff in Washington trying to clear the vice president’s offices as the transition of power loomed. \nSome members of Mr. Biden staff had already departed their roles, they said, and those who remained worked to maintain daily briefings and operations in a hectic final sprint while sorting through documents and belongings that were no longer needed.\nDuring his final two weeks, Mr. Biden presided over Congress for the counting of the electoral votes for the 2016 election, and then took a trip to California, where he appeared at a fundraiser for then Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and delivered a speech at a healthcare conference in San Francisco. After departing California, Mr. Biden attended an event in Chicago with outgoing President Barack Obama and then stopped in Detroit to visit the North American International Auto Show.\nAdvertisement\nDays later, Mr. Biden was surprised by Mr. Obama with the presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House, an event that brought together the then-vice president’s large extended family. \nMr. Biden then traveled to New York for an appearance on ABC’s “The View,” where he noted that he had personally written a classified memorandum for Vice President-elect Mike Pence. “He’ll call me and ask about, or I’ll call him about what’s going on in Ukraine, what’s going on here, what’s going on there,” Mr. Biden said at the time.\nThe capstone of his final days was a trip to Kyiv for a meeting with then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Among the classified documents discovered in the locales associated with Mr. Biden was a briefing paper related to Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nVice President Biden in Kyiv, Ukraine, with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, on one of Mr. Biden’s final days in office in January 2017.

Mr. Biden and his aides landed back at Joint Base Andrews on the evening of Jan. 18, with the inauguration a little more than a day away. \nWhile aboard Air Force Two, Mr. Biden spoke with the prime minister of Kosovo in an effort to defuse tensions with Serbia, and held separate conversations with the leaders of the Republic of Cyprus, Northern Cyprus and Greece to discuss settlement talks in the region. His final days in office also included a call with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi regarding the fight against ISIL, and a meeting with the prime minister of Ukraine during his stop in Kyiv.\nThe General Services Administration, a government agency, provides logistical support at the end of each administration. A GSA spokesman said outgoing White House staff “are responsible for substantive determinations about handling documents (e.g., collecting, reviewing, and categorizing documents, as well as determining where documents should be transported to).”\nThe spokesman said in 2017 the GSA provided about 5,300 square feet of office space to Mr. Biden’s transition team near the White House, and the team vacated the space on July 21, 2017.\nAt the time, Mr. Biden was in the process of renting a home in McLean, Va., where he lived for much of the Trump presidency, allowing the Bidens to be close to some of their grandchildren who lived in the Washington, D.C., area. The Bidens would also spend time at their Wilmington home after Mr. Biden left office.\nMr. Biden’s office at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, near the U.S. Capitol, didn’t officially open until February 2018.\nAruna Viswanatha, Sadie Gurman and Gordon Lubold contributed to this article.\nClassified Documents Found at President Biden's Home\nThe political and potential legal fallout of the discovery\nWhat We Know About the Classified Documents\nThe Biden Documents: A Timeline\nLeaving White House as VP, a Scramble to Pack\nClassified Documents Found at Biden’s Think Tank\nWrite to Ken Thomas at ken.thomas@wsj.com and Sabrina Siddiqui at sabrina.siddiqui@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 14, 2023, print edition as 'Biden Team Rushed to Pack Papers in 2017'.\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nFurther Reading\nOPINION\nDemocrats Are Stuck in the Soup\nTrump Officials Balk at RFK Jr.’s Attack on Pesticides\nTrump Clash With Library of Congress Sets Up Constitutional Fight\nThe Wild West of Presidential Pardons in Trump’s Second Term\nWith Qatari Plane Talks, Trump Sends Message to World: He’s Open for Business",

PHOTO: BEN BIRCHALL/PA WIRE/ZUMA PRESS\nLONDON—The U.K. said it would become the first known country to send Western-type main battle tanks to Ukraine, hoping to clear the way for other allies to follow suit and provide Ukraine the combat power it says it needs to retake territory Russia still occupies. \nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Saturday told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that Britain aimed to send Challenger 2 tanks and extra artillery systems to allow “Ukraine to press their advantage, win this war and secure a lasting peace,” according to a summary of their call published by Downing Street.\nIn a statement later Saturday, the prime minister’s office said a squadron of 14 tanks would go to Ukraine in coming weeks, which is expected to be followed by around 30 AS90 large, self-propelled guns. It also said the U.K. will start training Ukrainian armed forces on the tanks and guns in coming days.\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWhat’s News\nCatch up on the headlines, understand the news and make better decisions, free in your inbox daily. Enjoy a free article in every edition.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nOne of the main aims of Britain’s decision is to nudge the German government to approve the supply of its Leopard 2 tanks, of which there are several thousand held by armies across Europe, according to officials.  \nOfficials in Poland, Finland and other European nations are thinking about supplying Leopards to Ukraine, but they need permission from the German government to do so. A top German official said Germany would follow up on its pledge to send main battle tanks if other Western allies do so.\nMr. Zelensky tweeted that the U.K.’s decision “will not only strengthen us on the battlefield, but also send the right signal to other partners.” The commander in chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in December that the army needs 300 tanks to win back territory the Russians conquered last year, an analysis that Western military officials agree with. \nIn its statement, the British government said it would accelerate diplomatic and military support to aid Ukraine’s efforts to push back Russian forces as the anniversary of the war approaches late next month. “The Prime Minister is clear that a long and static war only serves Russia’s ends,” the statement said.\nThe initial provision of a small number of advanced tanks won’t by itself make a big or immediate difference on the battlefield, said Franz-Stefan Gady, a fellow with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. The logistics of setting up supply chains, fuel lines and trained crews for the complex machinery means the West isn’t likely to be able to deliver tanks in the kinds of numbers that would make a significant impact for at least many months to come.\nChallenger 2 tanks in a NATO exercise last spring in Estonia. PHOTO: BEN BIRCHALL/PA WIRE/ZUMA PRESS\nThat said, even providing a few dozen tanks means creating the repair yards and logistical centers that could make it much easier to send the next round of heavy combat vehicles. It signals a lasting commitment to building up Ukraine’s military, countering Russian President Vladimir Putin’s bet that the West will soon tire of aiding Ukraine, said Mr. Gady.\n“It will send a clear message that the West is in for the long haul,” he said. “Even for these small [numbers of] tanks you would need to build up a logistical supply chain. You could slowly build on that.”\nThere are some 2,000 Leopard 2 tanks held by 13 militaries across Europe including Turkey, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank. It notes that global stocks of these tanks are in varying states of readiness. Canada, for example, has an inventory of more than 80, but half are set aside for training purposes. For the moment, the only other country that has made a specific pledge is Poland, which has offered a company—typically 14 tanks.\nThe Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which coordinates support for Ukraine and includes defense ministers and military officials from around the world, is due to meet Jan 20. Members are expected to discuss how best to support Kyiv. German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said Thursday that Germany shouldn’t stand in the way of countries that want to send Leopards to Ukraine.\nRussia’s Embassy in the U.K. said Saturday that the tanks are “unlikely to help the Armed Forces of Ukraine turn the tide on the battlefield, and they will become a legitimate large target for Russian guns,” in comments carried by Russian state news agency TASS.\nBritish officials believe that, as the war in Ukraine shifts to a new phase, it makes sense to provide the Ukrainian army with heavy armor, something that was almost inconceivable just a few months ago. Russia is mobilizing personnel to the front lines, such as at the eastern city of Bakhmut, creating a numerical advantage that could work against Ukraine. If Ukraine is to mount a spring counterattack, it needs tanks to clear Russian lines without incurring huge losses in personnel, according to military analysts.\nAdvertisement\nFrance has pledged to send AMX-10 armored vehicles to Ukraine. PHOTO: EMMANUEL DUNAND/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nMoreover, some British officials feel that the West needs to more aggressively tilt the advantage in Ukraine’s favor with a larger supply of weapons to quickly help Ukraine into a position of relative strength from which it can negotiate an end to the war with Russia. Without this infusion of weaponry, they fear the war could drag on for years.  \nThe British Army’s Challenger 2 is more than two decades old, but it will still be the most advanced tank the Ukrainians have fielded in battle.

         "U.K. 7 min. Challenger 2 tanks during a. U.K. exercise in. Oman. LONDONThe. U.K. said it would become the first known country to send. Western-type main battle tanks to. Ukraine, hoping to clear the way for other allies to suit and provide. Ukraine the combat power it says it needs to retake territory. Russia still occupies. British. Prime. Minister. Rishi. Sunak on. Saturday told. Ukrainian. President. Volodymyr. Zelensky that. Britain aimed to send. Challenger 2 tanks and extra artillery systems to allow \"Ukraine to press their advantage, win this war and secure a lasting peace,\" according to a summary of their call published . In a statement later. Saturday, the prime minister's office said a squadron of 14 tanks would go to. Ukraine in coming weeks, which is expected to be followed by around 30. AS90 large, self-propelled guns. It also said the. U.K. will start training. Ukrainian armed forces on the tanks and guns in coming days. One of the main aims of. Britain's decision is to nudge the. German government to approve the supply of its. Leopard 2 tanks, of which there are several thousand held. Europe, according to officials. Officials in. Poland,. Finland and other. European nations are thinking about supplying. Leopards to. Ukraine, but they need permission from the. German government to do so. A top. German official said. Germany would up on its pledge to send main battle tanks if other. Western allies do so. Mr. Zelensky tweeted that the. U.K.'s decision \"will not only strengthen us on the battlefield, but also send the right signal to other partners.\". The commander in chief of the. Armed. Forces of. Ukraine said in. December that the army needs 300 tanks to win back territory the. Russians conquered last year, an analysis that. Western military officials agree with. In its statement, the. British government said it would accelerate diplomatic and military support to aid. Ukraine's efforts to push back. Russian forces as the anniversary of the war approaches late next month. \"The. Prime. Minister is clear that a long and static war only serves. Russia's ends,\" the statement said. The initial provision of a small number of advanced tanks won't a big or immediate difference on the battlefield, said. Franz-Stefan. Gady, a fellow with the. International. Institute for. Strategic. Studies in. London. The logistics of setting up supply chains, fuel lines and trained crews for the complex machinery means the. West isn't likely to be able to deliver tanks in the kinds of numbers that would make a significant impact for at least many months to come. Challenger 2 tanks in a. NATO exercise last spring in. Estonia. That said, even providing a few dozen tanks means creating the repair yards and logistical centers that could make it much easier to send the next round of heavy combat vehicles. It signals a lasting commitment to building up. Ukraine's military, countering. Russian. President. Vladimir. Putin's bet that the. West will soon tire of aiding. Ukraine, said. Mr. Gady. \"It will send a clear message that the. West is in for the long haul,\" he said. \"Even for these small numbers of tanks you would need to build up a logistical supply chain. You could slowly build on that.\". There are some 2,000. Leopard 2 tanks held by 13 militaries across. Europe including. Turkey, according to the. European. Council on. Foreign. Relations, a think tank. It notes that global stocks of these tanks are in varying states of readiness. Canada, for example, has an inventory of more than 80, but half are set aside for training purposes. For the moment, the only other country that has made a specific pledge is. Poland, which has offered a companytypically 14 tanks. The. Ukraine. Defense. Contact. Group, which coordinates support for. Ukraine and includes defense ministers and military officials from around the world, is due to meet. Jan 20. Members are expected to discuss how best to support. Kyiv. German. Vice. Chancellor. Robert. Habeck said. Thursday that. Germany shouldn't stand in the way of countries that want to send. Leopards to. Ukraine. Russia's. Embassy in the. U.K. said. Saturday that the tanks are \"unlikely to help the. Armed. Forces of. Ukraine turn the tide on the battlefield, and they will become a legitimate large target for. Russian guns,\" in comments carried news agency. TASS. British officials believe that, as the war in. Ukraine shifts to a new phase, it makes sense to provide the. Ukrainian army with heavy armor, something that was almost inconceivable just a few months ago. Russia is mobilizing personnel to the front lines, such as at the eastern city of. Bakhmut, creating a numerical advantage that could work against. Ukraine. If. Ukraine is to mount a spring counterattack, it needs tanks to clear. Russian lines without incurring huge losses in personnel, according to military analysts. France has pledged to send. AMX-10 armored vehicles to. Ukraine. Moreover, some. British officials feel that the. West needs to more aggressively tilt the advantage in. Ukraine's favor with a larger supply of weapons to quickly help. Ukraine into a position of relative strength from which it can negotiate an end to the war with. Russia. Without this infusion of weaponry, they fear the war could drag on for years. The. British. Army's. Challenger 2 is more than two decades old, but it will still be the most advanced tank the. Ukrainians have fielded in battle. Up until now, most of the heavy armor provided such as. Poland have been old. Soviet-era tanks. The. U.K. has a stock of around 227. Challenger 2 tanks and is in the process of replacing them with a modernized version. Biden administration officials have said they don't object to other countries providing tanks and welcome the. British contribution. Meanwhile, they remain open to providing. U.S. Abrams tanks to. Ukraine but haven't decided to do so, nor do they anticipate that tanks would be announced in the near future, officials said this past week. \"This is something that we absolutely agree that. Ukraine does need tanks,\" said. Laura. Cooper, a top. Pentagon policy official, earlier this month. But the. U.S. remains worried about the training and logistics required to use an. Abrams tank, which. Ms. Cooper said is a \"gas guzzler.\". The. U.S. wants to make sure. Ukrainians can operate and maintain the tanks before the. U.S. provides them, administration officials said.

Join the conversation below.\nWages tend to be “stickier” than inflation, said Credit Suisse economist Jeremy Schwartz. They don’t rise and fall as rapidly as consumer prices. That means wage gains could exceed inflation for a little while until they come back into rough alignment, he said.\nMr. Schwartz sees year-over-year wage increases falling to just above 4% by the end of 2023, while inflation weakens to around 3% on the year.\n“In terms of not seeing such painful price increases and having your income stretch further, this could be a pretty good year for consumers,” he said.\nDespite the possible return of real wage gains, workers could suffer if the economy tips into recession this year, as many economists expect. A recession would likely lead to layoffs and push up the unemployment rate from December’s 3.5%. Fed officials see the unemployment rate rising to 4.6% by the end of the year.\n“If you retain a job you’ll be in better shape,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. “It’s just that there’s going to be an increased risk of layoffs for this year.”\nWrite to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com\nInflation and the Economy\nAnalysis from The Wall Street Journal, selected by the editors\nInflation Has Cooled, but Americans Are Still Seething Over Prices\nLower Interest Rates Don’t Guarantee a Soft Landing\nThe American Dream Feels Out of Reach for Most\nInflation's Impact on the Poor vs. the Rich\nSHOW CONVERSATION (185)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nFurther Reading\nPowell Steers New Strategy for a World Where Very Low Rates Are No Sure Thing\nTreasury Yields Rise Amid Trade Talk Developments\nWeek Ahead for FX, Bonds: Focus on Trade News, U.S. Inflation, Retail Sales Data\nOPINION\nA New Strategy to Fight Inflation\nWhy the Fed Isn’t Ready to Join Other Central Banks in Cutting Rates",

VA officials are trying to find ways to address concerns many veterans have about seeking mental-health treatment or discussing their guns and firearms safety. \nMost veterans are now eligible for 30 days of inpatient or 90 days of outpatient care, and the VA said it is streamlining access to private facilities for those deemed to be at imminent risk of self-harm. The change expands eligibility for such services to also include the approximately nine million veterans who aren’t enrolled in the VA system.\nThe VA effort has also included a partnership with the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a major firearms trade group, to bridge political and ideological divisions. Next week, for the first time, the VA will headline part of the NSSF’s shooting, hunting and outdoor trade event known as SHOT Show, the nation’s largest firearms trade show. \nThe check-in desk at a VA outpatient clinic in Portland, Maine. PHOTO: PATRICK OUELLETTE/PORTLAND PRESS HERALD/GETTY IMAGES\nThe renewed push to address veteran suicide-by-firearm began during the Trump administration in 2017 and 2018, said Dr. Matthew Miller, head of suicide prevention for the VA. \n“We sat down at VA and said we need to do something more,” he said in an interview. “We said, ‘Why don’t we do something about the factor that’s involved with 70% of suicides?’ And that’s firearms.”\nVeterans are more likely than civilians to own firearms, and they are more likely to use them for suicide, according to VA statistics. And gun owners can become defensive about any effort to address firearm restrictions, which precluded discussion of preventing firearm suicide in the past, said Ari Freilich, state policy director at Giffords Law Center, which seeks to end gun violence.\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nThe 10-Point\nA personal, guided tour to the best scoops and stories every day in The Wall Street Journal.\nPreview\nSubscribed\n“It’s really important to talk about where we were a decade ago,” he said, with gun companies and lobbyists all but refusing to talk about links between firearm access and suicide. \nSince then, groups such as the NSSF have begun to address the need to talk about firearm suicide. Mr. Freilich said the industry should have talked about these matters long ago, and that it continues to profit off weapons that bring people harm, but it is important to recognize the crucial change that has taken place.\n“We need credible messengers to reach people where they are and trust it,” he said. “That’s such a bedrock of our work.”\nWhile there are political policy debates about ways to address firearms issues through legislation, these disparate groups have tried to find common ground and focus on solutions that can save lives. One such solution is widespread use of gun locks and having gun owners put what is known as time and distance between themselves and firearms and ammunition when possible. That includes storing ammunition separately from weapons and even persuading gun owners to trust someone close to them to safeguard their guns for them when they might be in crisis.\nIn 2016, NSSF joined with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention after gun retailers and members began asking more about the issue, said Dr. Doreen Marshall, vice president of mission engagement for the suicide-prevention organization.\n“NSSF saying, ‘This is important’—it changed the dialogue nationally,” she said.\nThen in 2019, the NSSF joined with the VA to bring the message to veterans.\nRep. Chris Stewart says his work with veterans made him realize the acute crisis that needed to be addressed.  PHOTO: GEORGE FREY/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n“Organizations like the VA recognize that we have the ability to reach a community that they might not be able to reach,” said Joe Bartozzi, president and chief executive of the NSSF. “I’d like to believe that it has helped to open up the dialogue.”\nMr. Bartozzi said veterans need to understand that they can get assistance for mental-health crises and not be in danger of having their weapons confiscated, a common concern among the demographic. He said his organization’s members have asked for more training and information on suicide prevention, and because it is coming from their trusted organization, it has opened up the conversation in ways that weren’t possible in the past.\nThe VA has tailored messaging so that it focuses not on restricting access to firearms but on safety surrounding the use, storage and understanding of firearms, Dr. Miller of the VA said.\nAdvertisement\nThat includes advocating for training doctors and mental-health professionals in the basics of gun culture and concerns gun owners have about seeking mental-health treatment. Dr. Miller said such training modules have become standard at the VA. \n“Suicide is preventable, and once you understand that concept, there’s no reason not to get involved,” Mr. Bartozzi said.\nEven as the VA has expanded efforts, officials say more can be done, especially in tracking outcomes. Dr. Miller said the VA doesn’t have reliable statistics on the outcomes of many of the programs because it is nearly impossible to point to one variable in something as complicated as suicide. But he said this year funding has been set aside to better assess outcomes. \nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nIs encouraging gun safety an effective way to prevent suicides? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\nAccording to the VA’s most recent statistics, veteran suicide rates were up in 2018 and then fell for two straight years (the department’s statistics lag behind by two years). But suicide among veterans remains higher than among the civilian population. \nMany lawmakers in Washington have sought to address suicide prevention, and some of the biggest proponents of such measures say they have to keep some distance from efforts like those being made by the VA and the NSSF.\n“We have, by intention, stayed out of those conversations,” said Rep. Chris Stewart (R., Utah) one of the most vocal lawmakers when it comes to suicide prevention and a primary driver of legislation establishing the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.\n“If you have a Republican who’s supporting something, Democrats are suspicious. And the other way around,” he said. When Mr. Stewart first came to Congress in 2013, he didn’t intend to champion suicide prevention, he said, but his work with veterans made him realize the acute crisis that needed to be addressed. \n“I’m so glad other people are involved, and they see this as a problem that they want to get involved in,” he said.\nHelp is available: Reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) by dialing or texting 988. \nWrite to Ben Kesling at ben.kesling@wsj.com\nSHOW CONVERSATION (29)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nFurther Reading\nTreasury Yields Rise as U.S. Services Sector Keeps Expanding\nU.S. Activity Rebounds But Inflation Heats Up on Tariff Concerns",

Jack Kennedy said that the shooting occurred early Sunday morning in the Strip off University Boulevard near campus. He said Jamea Harris, 23 years old, of the Birmingham area was shot and killed.\nMr. Miles, 21, a junior reserve forward from Washington, D.C., and Michael Lynn Davis, 20, of Charles County, Md., were both charged with capital murder. The capital murder charge arose because the death involved shots fired into a vehicle, Capt. Kennedy said.\n“At this time, it appears that the only motive was a minor altercation that these individuals had with the victim as they were out on the Strip,” Capt. Kennedy said in a news conference Sunday evening.\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWhat’s News\nCatch up on the headlines, understand the news and make better decisions, free in your inbox daily.

Al Sharpton on what would have been Dr. King’s 94th birthday. “Will we choose democracy over autocracy, community over chaos, love over hate? These are the questions of our time.”\nThe remarks came a day after Mr. Biden traveled to Atlanta for another celebration commemorating Dr. King, whom he referred to as one of his “only political heroes,” at Ebenezer Baptist Church. Speaking before an audience that included Dr. King’s sister, Christine King Farris, and other members of his family, Mr. Biden became the first sitting president to deliver a Sunday sermon at the historic church where Dr. King often preached. \nIn both speeches, Mr. Biden struck a somber tone as he spoke of an “inflection point” for civil rights, democracy and social justice. Whereas the president spent much of his Sunday sermon drawing on the teachings of Dr. King, whom he praised as a “nonviolent warrior for justice,” Mr. Biden’s remarks at Monday’s breakfast were more centered around his political agenda and congressional Republicans.\nMartin Luther King Jr. Honored\nThe nation celebrated the life and achievements of the U.S. civil-rights leader on Monday\n1 of 2\nANDREW HARNIK/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n1\n2\nMr. Biden said he stands ready to work with the new Republican House majority, even as he criticized GOP lawmakers for blocking police reform and voting rights legislation. He referred to some of them as being “fiscally demented” for their opposition to government spending, as his administration prepares for a potential showdown over raising the government’s debt ceiling.\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said Sunday he would seek to negotiate with the White House over raising the federal debt ceiling but renewed his calls for cuts in spending, days after the Treasury Department said the government may not be able to pay its bills by early summer.\n“Let’s sit down together. Let’s look at the places that we can change our behavior,” Mr. McCarthy said in an interview on Fox News. “Why would we sit back and be so arrogant to say, ‘No, there’s no waste in government?’”\nMr. Biden also objected to Republicans who have sought to play down the legacy of slavery, segregation and racial discrimination in the U.S., stating that “silence is complicity.”  \n“The idea that we’re supposed to remain silent on the abuses of the past as if they didn’t occur?

PHOTO: KEVIN DIETSCH/GETTY IMAGES\nWASHINGTON—U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will meet with senior Chinese official Liu He this week as the two superpowers try to rekindle a relationship that accounts for much of the world’s economic activity but has grown tense over technology access, trade policy and Taiwan. \nThe pair will meet Wednesday in Zurich, where Ms. Yellen is stopping ahead of a multicountry tour through Africa that is aimed in part at countering China’s influence on the continent. Mr. Liu, who is expected to step down from his post in March but is close to Chinese President Xi Jinping, is expected to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The two sides arranged to meet in a third country while they are both abroad.\nSenior U.S. and Chinese officials have only recently started meeting again after China cut off most such communications following then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan last year. President Biden and Mr. Xi in November agreed to resume contacts among top officials, and Ms. Yellen is looking at traveling to China after Secretary of State Antony Blinken visits next month, according to people familiar with the matter. U.S. officials have been unsure who Ms. Yellen’s next counterpart will be after a Chinese government reshuffle. \nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWhat’s News\nCatch up on the headlines, understand the news and make better decisions, free in your inbox daily.

Chinese officials are moving to try to revitalize their economy and soften their rhetoric toward Washington. The U.S. and Ms. Yellen, meanwhile, are scrutinizing perceived national-security risks in Chinese technology, while also aiming to avoid undue harm to an engine of global economic growth. \n“Secretary Yellen has got a big challenge,” said Matt Goodman, senior vice president for economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. “That’s making the case for growth on one hand and on the other being forceful for the U.S. need to protect our national security.”\nA Treasury official said the department doesn’t view protecting national security and promoting global economic growth to be at odds with each other. Regular communication with Chinese officials can help accomplish both goals, the Treasury official said. \nThe U.S. last year imposed wide-ranging export controls on advanced semiconductors, a step aimed at hobbling China’s ability to develop its military capabilities. The Biden administration is working on an executive order on screening U.S. investment in certain Chinese technology sectors, including advanced semiconductors. \nWith both the export controls that are in place and the potential outbound investment restrictions, some Treasury officials are concerned that the steps could slow China’s access to technology for ordinary commercial purposes as well. Ms. Yellen, who has pushed for U.S. companies to become less reliant on China, is concerned that China could retaliate against the U.S. economy, according to people familiar with her thinking. If Chinese officials see U.S. policies as too punitive, they could cut off U.S. access to goods such as solar panels, for example. \n“The defense and intelligence agencies are frequently going to have more restrictive views on these questions than the Treasury,” said Mark Sobel, a former Treasury official who is the U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think tank. “Treasury’s macro-analysis well understands there are spillovers and spillbacks and interdependencies, and these are issues that need to be managed for the global economy.”\nChina’s Liu He previously encouraged the U.S. to relax its tariffs on the country’s goods. PHOTO: LEAH MILLIS/REUTERS\nTreasury officials, who have held a series of meetings with private-sector participants to discuss the possible investment controls on China, have sought to more narrowly target the White House order, according to people familiar with the matter. Outstanding questions include how many Chinese technology sectors would be subject to the controls, whether the government would outright ban investment in them and how investors would comply with the new rules, these people said.\nThe difficulty of resolving those questions has slowed progress on crafting the executive order, according to people familiar with the talks. \n“There’s not even consensus around how to scope this,” said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has studied export controls. \nThe Treasury Department is also leading a review into the U.S. operations of TikTok, which is owned by a Chinese parent company, at the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., an interagency government panel. Treasury officials have warned against requiring the divestment of TikTok’s U.S. operations as other Biden administration officials have pushed for that option, The Journal has reported. \nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat should the U.S.-China relationship look like? Join the conversation below.\nAfter her meeting with Mr. Liu, Ms. Yellen will travel to Senegal, Zambia and South Africa. China has deepened its ties on the African continent in recent years, lending to many low-income countries. Zambia has struggled to reach an agreement with its Chinese creditors to restructure its debt. Ms. Yellen has repeatedly criticized China’s behavior as a creditor as the U.S. tries to bolster its own influence in Africa. \n“It seems like it’s a form of catch-up here,” Rama Yade, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Africa center, said of the Biden administration’s renewed outreach to Africa. \nOn trade, Ms. Yellen has called for “friendshoring,” a term used to describe companies reorienting their supply chains into countries such as India to be less dependent on China—drawing criticism from Chinese officials. \nBut she has also pushed for the U.S. to relax some of its tariffs on Chinese goods. When Ms. Yellen and Mr. Liu spoke in a call over the summer, Mr. Liu said he had seen Ms. Yellen’s comments on tariffs and he encouraged the U.S. to relax them, according to people familiar with the call. \nAdvertisement\nWrite to Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 17, 2023, print edition as 'Yellen Seeks to Smooth Ties With Beijing'.\nSHOW CONVERSATION (98)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nFurther Reading\nWhy the Fed Isn’t Ready to Join Other Central Banks in Cutting Rates\nFed Reviewing Its Secret Ratings for the Nation’s Biggest Banks\nOPINION\nKevin Warsh on Fed Policy and Independence\nTrump Says Powell is a Loser.

Australia closed its borders to noncitizens for nearly two years, while its states and territories adopted different strategies when policing their internal borders, in some cases setting new rules for passengers midflight.\nBefore its acquisition by Boston-based Bain Capital for $2.45 billion, Virgin Australia was listed on Australia’s main stock exchange for 16 years.

The carrier said people appeared to be making travel a priority and that limits on international capacity seemed to be spurring a rise in domestic vacations. \nLast week, a new Australian budget carrier, Bonza Aviation Pty Ltd., was granted regulatory approval to begin passenger flights. \nBain Capital’s Mr. Murphy said Virgin Australia, led by Chief Executive Jayne Hrdlicka, had achieved an impressive transformation. Before the pandemic, the airline had struggled to turn a profit on its international routes, although its domestic operations and loyalty program were moneymakers.\n“Bain Capital will ensure these preliminary deliberations are not a distraction for Virgin Australia management, who can remain 100% focused on their roles,” Mr. Murphy said. \nAdvertisement\nWrite to Rhiannon Hoyle at rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 17, 2023, print edition as 'Firm Weighs Virgin Australia IPO as Travel Rebounds'.\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nRECOMMENDED VIDEOS",

Inc. last week raised its revenue guidance for the recently ended quarter as demand for air travel remained strong through the holiday season, even as travelers contended with higher fares. In. November,. Qantas raised its half-year profit guidance and said its net debt should be significantly lower than expected. The carrier said people appeared to be making travel a priority and that limits on international capacity seemed to be spurring a rise in domestic vacations. Last week, a new. Australian budget carrier,. Bonza. Aviation. Pty. Ltd., was granted regulatory approval to begin passenger flights. Bain. Capital's. Mr. Murphy said. Virgin. Australia, led. Jayne. Hrdlicka, had achieved an impressive transformation. Before the pandemic, the airline had struggled to turn a profit on its international routes, although its domestic operations and loyalty program were moneymakers. \"Bain. Capital will ensure these preliminary deliberations are not a distraction for. Virgin. Australia management, who can remain 100 focused on their roles,\". Mr. Murphy said. Secret. Purges,. Tense.

Former President Donald Trump won Indiana by 16 percentage points in 2020.  \n“It’s a long way until the May 2024 primary but I wanted to get a head start,” he said. “I’ve got strong support in northern Indiana where I’m from.” \nIn Mr. Banks’s announcement video, he talks about social issues that have become a top focus in the Republican party, saying he wants to “protect the unborn,” a reference to abortion restrictions, and “keep girls’ sports for girls,” referring to banning transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports competitions. \n“I’m proud that the House last week passed the Born Alive Act and when I get to the Senate, I’m going to be a strong pro-life voice,” he said in the interview, referencing an abortion-related bill that the House passed last week.  \nClub for Growth PAC, a leading conservative organization that spends heavily in GOP races, endorsed Mr. Banks in the primary, with President David McIntosh saying Club for Growth PAC and its Club for Growth Action super PAC “are prepared to spend whatever it takes to help Banks secure the nomination and victory.”\nMr. Banks tried unsuccessfully last year to run for House majority whip, losing to Rep. Tom Emmer (R., Minn.). He served as the chair of the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative House lawmakers, from 2021 to 2023. \nHe voted against certifying the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021. Then-House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy appointed him to serve on the select committee investigating the Capitol riot on that day, but his appointment was blocked by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.).\nThe Senate looks favorable for Republicans in 2024, when Democrats and independents who align with them will be defending about two dozen seats, while Republicans are defending far fewer.\nAdvertisement\nWrite to Natalie Andrews at natalie.andrews@wsj.com\nSHOW CONVERSATION (7)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nRECOMMENDED VIDEOS",

More companies likely would turn to a patchwork of alternative mechanisms to keep people from leaving and taking valuable information with them, including nondisclosure agreements and employment contracts that reward longevity, they say. \nTHE JOURNAL.\nCould This Be the End of Noncompetes?\n16:36\n1x\nSUBSCRIBE\nAdd to Queue\nExplore Audio Center\n“Employers have operated with an understanding that they can protect their interests through noncompetes,” said Matthew Durham, a Salt Lake City-based attorney with Dorsey & Whitney LLP who advises companies on employment matters. “What you’re seeing, reflected in the FTC proposal and elsewhere, is a growing hostility to the idea that there should be those kinds of restrictions, and it’s changing the environment that employers have been comfortable with in the last number of years.”\nThe FTC proposed a ban this month on nearly all noncompetes, saying that the clauses—which typically prohibit workers from moving to a new employer or starting new ventures of their own—hamper competition in the labor market, suppress wages and hold back innovation and entrepreneurship. The proposal came in response to an executive order from President Biden in 2021.\nBusinesses say they impose noncompete clauses on employees to protect trade secrets and other confidential information, including customer lists and financial data.\nThe FTC contends that noncompete clauses discourage innovation and entrepreneurship. PHOTO: ERIC LEE FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nMr. Durham and others say they believe the FTC may narrow its rule after hearing comments from the public, including employers and business organizations that have already signaled their opposition to the current proposal. The agency could, for example, allow noncompetes for highly compensated workers.\nNoncompetes are common in employment contracts for senior employees like software engineers, sales representatives and top executives. Over time, they have been applied to many parts of the U.S. workforce, including some janitors, baristas, schoolteachers and entry-level workers. According to the FTC, one in five U.S. workers is currently subject to a noncompete clause.\nNoncompetes are regulated at the state level, and many states have already taken action to limit use of the clauses by, in some cases, forbidding employers from imposing them on people earning under a particular wage threshold or for certain types of workers. \n“The vast majority of people in America can’t afford a lawyer to defend a noncompete case,” said Jonathan Pollard, an attorney in Florida who represents workers whose employers are trying to enforce noncompete clauses. “Just the threat of enforcement is often enough to restrain talent in the labor market.”\nThe Federal Trade Commission proposed a new ban on noncompete clauses, which the agency says hurts workers and competition. Companies argue they protect trade secrets. WSJ breaks down what a federal ban could mean for workers and businesses. Photo illustration: Jacob Reynolds\nSome states, such as California and Oklahoma, hold that the clauses are unenforceable in all or nearly all employment contracts. \nA number of studies suggest noncompetes suppress wages and innovation. A review of Oregon’s 2008 ban on noncompetes for hourly workers found that wages rose an average of 2% to 3%. Another study, examining Hawaii’s 2015 ban on noncompete agreements for high-tech workers, found an 11% increase in job moves and a 4% increase in new-hire salaries.\nThe clauses restrain not just pay and entrepreneurship, but also professional development, workers and some attorneys say. \nDaniel Bachhuber had worked as a software consultant for years when he decided to take an in-house job in the fall of 2018. His new employer required that he sign a one-year noncompete agreement, which he said was so broad it would have prevented him from practicing his core skills if he were to leave the company or be fired.\nMr. Bachhuber balked. Earlier in his career, he had been laid off a few weeks into a new job, just after his first child was born. If that happened at the new job, he recalled thinking, he would be unable to earn a living for a year. “I’m always thinking, worst case scenario, what kind of downstream protection do I have?” the 35-year-old said. “Even if I was employed just one day, I couldn’t go back to the same clients I had.”\nDaniel Bachhuber turned down a job after an employer wouldn’t change a noncompete clause. PHOTO: MASON TRINCA FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nHe consulted a lawyer and tried to renegotiate the contract, hoping to salvage a role that would have expanded his skills and given him a chance to work directly with the chief technology officer on special projects. The company declined to change the noncompete clause and, reluctantly, Mr. Bachhuber turned down the position. \nEmployers have other tools to protect information besides noncompete agreements, including nondisclosure agreements, trade secret laws and nonsolicitation agreements, which prohibit workers from poaching customers or employees of their prior firm. \nBut those tools generally can only be used after an employee violates the agreement, said Julie Levinson Werner, who represents employers as a partner with law firm Lowenstein Sandler LLP. “Once someone goes to another company, you’re really on the honor system. You have no way to monitor what information is being disclosed or not,” she said.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nDo you think noncompetes should be banned? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\nObservers on both sides say that limitations on the clauses will compel employers to get more creative about how they retain talent, using everything from compensation to career advancement to keep workers engaged and loyal to the company. Some companies use deferred compensation—such as retention bonuses or rolling stock options that vest after, say, three years—to give people incentives to stay.\n“Do you get better results with honey or vinegar?” said Ms. Werner. “If you want to motivate people and have them happy to stay, you have to look at compensation, the overall environment, how you treat them.”\nThe fate of the FTC’s final rule is up in the air. After a 60-day comment period, the commissioners will consider potential changes to the initial proposal and then issue a final rule. That rule will likely be challenged by business groups or individual companies, and courts will determine its trajectory, attorneys say.\nAdvertisement\nWrite to Lauren Weber at Lauren.Weber@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 18, 2023, print edition as 'Alternatives to Noncompete Clauses Sought'.\nSHOW CONVERSATION (292)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nFurther Reading\nDealmakers Are Struggling to Make Sense of Trump’s Antitrust Policy\nInside Mark Zuckerberg’s Failed Negotiations to End Antitrust Case\nZuckerberg, on Witness Stand, Rebuffs Claims Meta Monopolizes Social-Media Market\nStellantis to Revise Ads Saying Its Cars Are Built in America\nZuckerberg Lobbies Trump to Avoid Meta Antitrust Trial",

         "Title: The Latest TikTok Star Is Canned Tuna\n\nBUSINESS\nRETAIL\nThe Latest TikTok Star Is Canned Tuna\nCanned-fish sellers launch new products, expand production to meet demand from younger shoppers\nBy Yusuf KhanFollow\n| Photographs by Kelsey McClellan for The Wall Street Journal\nJan. 17, 2023 5:30 am ET\nSAVE\nSHARE\nTEXT\nListen to article\nLength\n(5 minutes)\nQueue\nExplore Audio Center\nMakers of canned tuna and sardines are taking their products upscale, riding a wave of online popularity among young foodies.\nU.S. sales of canned seafood rose 9.7% to $2.7 billion in 2022, according to data provider Euromonitor International, with industry executives crediting the increase to a surge in demand from younger shoppers seeking novel but still affordable foods. \nTo capitalize on the trend, canned-fish sellers are launching new products, expanding production and working with social-media influencers. The cans now feature flavored olive oils, tomato sauces and spices, sport snazzy labels and cost as much as $20.\nMathew Scaletta, chief executive of Wildfish Cannery, said he has seen a noticeable increase in sales of canned fish and that the Alaska-based company is struggling to meet demand. Wildfish first saw sales jump in 2020 amid the pandemic, he said, and last year its wholesale revenue doubled.\nWildfish touts that its tinned fish is harvested, smoked and hand-packed in Alaska, and includes flavoring such as sumac and dill. Its products carry a higher price tag than typical grocery-store tuna varieties that sell for a couple of dollars. “Before we had a lot of explaining to do when people asked, ‘Why is this can $20?’” Mr. Scaletta said.\nWildfish has leased new production space and added equipment to keep up and is now in the early stages of planning a new cannery on Alaska’s Prince of Wales Island, Mr. Scaletta said.\nLarger canned-fish producers, such as Bumble Bee Foods LLC, are ramping up marketing efforts. The San Diego-based company last year launched a “Good for You” advertising campaign targeting a younger audience to promote its higher-end cans and dispel perceptions that canned fish isn’t versatile or fitting of foodie aspirations. It also sells a “Protein on the Run” line, which comes with crackers, a spoon and a caramel treat.\n“Tuna can do more than the standard tuna sandwich,” said Jeremy Zavoral, Bumble Bee’s brand marketing director. “It’s possible to have a gourmet experience with a can of tuna.”\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nHow do you incorporate canned fish into your meal planning? Join the conversation below.\nA big driver of interest, industry executives say, has been social media. A search on the social-media app TikTok shows to date more than 25 million views for videos tagged #tinnedfish, with users sharing their experiences with different cans and recommending certain brands. \nAli Hooke, a former professional chef who now makes online food videos, posted her first “tinned fish date night” video last year when stuck at home with little to eat. “We just had some tinned fish in the cabinet and so we poured a really nice glass of wine and toasted some sourdough,” she said. “That was all we had, but it was so fun and so enjoyable.” \nVariety of tinned fish.\nSince then, she has posted more than a dozen such date-night videos to guide couples looking to experiment with new foods at home, featuring cans of sardines or mussels from different countries such as Denmark and France used as the centerpiece of a charcuterie board. \nCanned-fish producers say the online buzz has fueled sales. Scout Canning, based in Vancouver, said its revenues rose 82% to $4 million last year. To help boost its exposure, the company has worked with popular TikTok users such as Ms. Hooke, who alone refers roughly 500 people a month to its site, the company said.\nAdam Bent, Scout’s chief executive, said consumers were using artisan canned fish as a sort of “cultural cachet” to impress friends and family.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s the same kind of experience that you have with natural wine,” Mr. Bent said. “It’s kind of that next cool food item.”\nScout said it plans to launch new product kits that pair its cans of yellowfin tuna with crunchy toppers including jalapeño and za’atar. It has also started sourcing fish from Mexico, alongside the U.S. and Canada, to help meet demand.\nWhile the rise in demand has been a boon for producers, it has resulted in some supply problems for specialty retailers.\nPatrick Martinez, founder of U.K.-based the Tinned Fish Market, started selling canned seafood four years ago in markets in Liverpool, Manchester and London. He sources many of his products from small producers in Spain and Portugal, where canned fish has long been a popular cheap food option.\nNow, higher demand is leading to delays of up to five months, Mr. Martinez said, with many products only made to order. “This type of artisanal production can’t be scaled up easily,” he said.\nHe said suppliers had raised prices but he had so far refrained from passing on the cost to avoid putting off new younger customers.\nClaire Dinhut has posted videos showing her online followers the range of canned fish varieties and recipe ideas, even though some comments call them bizarre. “I think there used to be a lot of shame associated with tinned fish,” Ms. Dinhut said. “One, because it was considered a poor man’s food and two, because, oh, it’s stinky.”\nWrite to Yusuf Khan at yusuf.khan@wsj.com\nAdvertisement\nAppeared in the January 18, 2023, print edition as 'Canned Seafood Becomes a TikTok Star'.\nSHOW CONVERSATION (0)",

Makers of canned tuna and sardines are taking their products upscale, riding a wave of online popularity among young foodies. U.S. sales of canned seafood rose 9.7 to 2.7 billion in , according to data provider. Euromonitor. International, with industry executives crediting the increase to a surge in demand from younger shoppers seeking novel but still affordable foods. To capitalize on the trend, canned-fish sellers are launching new products, expanding production and working with social-media influencers. The cans now feature flavored olive oils, tomato sauces and spices, sport snazzy labels and cost as much as 20. Mathew. Scaletta, chief executive of. Wildfish. Cannery, said he has seen a noticeable increase in sales of canned fish and that the. Alaska-based company is struggling to meet demand. Wildfish first saw sales jump in amid the pandemic, he said, and last year its wholesale revenue doubled. Wildfish touts that its tinned fish is harvested, smoked and hand-packed in. Alaska, and includes flavoring such as sumac and dill. Its products carry a higher price tag than typical grocery-store tuna varieties that sell for a couple of dollars. \"Before we had a lot of explaining to do when people asked, 'Why is this can 20?'\". Mr. Scaletta said. Wildfish has leased new production space and added equipment to keep up and is now in the early stages of planning a new cannery on. Alaska's. Prince of. Wales. Island,. Mr. Scaletta said. Larger canned-fish producers, such as. Bumble. Bee. Foods. LLC, are ramping up marketing efforts. The. San. Diego-based company last year launched a \"Good for. You\" advertising campaign targeting a younger audience to promote its higher-end cans and dispel perceptions that canned fish isn't versatile or fitting of foodie aspirations. It also sells a \"Protein on the. Run\" line, which comes with crackers, a spoon and a caramel treat. \"Tuna can do more than the standard tuna sandwich,\" said. Jeremy. Zavoral,. Bumble. Bee's brand marketing director. \"It's possible to have a gourmet experience with a can of tuna.\". How do you incorporate canned fish into your meal planning? Join the conversation below. A big driver of interest, industry executives say, has been social media. A search on the social-media app. TikTok shows to date more than 25 million views for tagged tinnedfish, with users sharing their experiences with different cans and recommending certain brands. Ali. Hooke, a former professional chef who now makes online food , posted her first \"tinned fish date night\" video last year when stuck at home with little to eat. \"We just had some tinned fish in the cabinet and so we poured a really nice glass of wine and toasted some sourdough,\" she said. \"That was all we had, but it was so fun and so enjoyable.\". Variety of tinned fish. Since then, she has posted more than a dozen such date-night to guide couples looking to experiment with new foods at home, featuring cans of sardines or mussels from different countries such as. Denmark and. France used as the centerpiece of a charcuterie board. Canned-fish producers say the online buzz has fueled sales. Scout. Canning, based in. Vancouver, said its revenues rose 82 to 4 million last year. To help boost its exposure, the company has worked with popular. TikTok users such as. Ms. Hooke, who alone refers roughly 500 people a month to its site, the company said. Adam. Bent,. Scout's chief executive, said consumers were using artisan canned fish as a sort of \"cultural cachet\" to impress friends and family. \"It's the same kind of experience that you have with natural wine,\". Mr. Bent said. \"It's kind of that next cool food item.\". Scout said it plans to launch new product kits that pair its cans of yellowfin tuna with crunchy toppers including jalapeo and za'atar. It has also started sourcing fish from. Mexico, alongside the. U.S. and. Canada, to help meet demand. While the rise in demand has been a boon for producers, it has resulted in some supply problems for specialty retailers. Patrick. Martinez, founder of. U.K.-based the. Tinned. Fish. Market, started selling canned seafood four years ago in markets in. Liverpool,. Manchester and. London. He sources many of his products from small producers in. Spain and. Portugal, where canned fish has long been a popular cheap food option. Now, higher demand is leading to delays of up to five months,. Mr. Martinez said, with many products only made to order. \"This type of artisanal production can't be scaled up easily,\" he said. He said suppliers had raised prices but he had so far refrained from passing on the cost to avoid putting off new younger customers. Claire. Dinhut has posted showing her online followers the range of canned fish varieties and recipe ideas, even though some comments call them bizarre. \"I think there used to be a lot of shame associated with tinned fish,\". Ms. Dinhut said. \"One, because it was considered a poor man's food and two, because, oh, it's stinky.\"",

         "Vote signals pilots' growing frustration with talks and the carrier's recent meltdown 4 min. Southwest. Airlines experienced severe difficulties recovering from a recent winter storm. pilots plan to vote later this year on whether to authorize union leaders to call for a strike should they deem it necessary, as they become increasingly frustrated with what they say are stalled contract negotiations. Capt. Casey. Murray, president of the. Southwest. Airlines. Pilots. Association union, told members. Wednesday that the union plans to hold the vote starting. May 1, citing what he said was a lack of progress years into talks with the airline. An affirmative vote from the airline's pilots wouldn't mean a strike is inevitable or imminent but would convey pilots' support for union leaders to pursue a walk-off under a process governed rules. The vote is largely symbolic, and. Mr. Murray said in an interview that it is akin to a vote of \"no confidence\" that would express pilots' displeasure.

Ryan Barber\n,\nAruna Viswanatha\nand\nSadie Gurman\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(6 min)\nRobert Hur is a Justice Department veteran with experience in the George W. Bush and Donald Trump administrations, including as U.S. attorney for Maryland. PHOTO: MICHAEL MCCOY/REUTERS\nWASHINGTON—Weeks after adding the National Football League as a client, former prosecutor Robert Hur received a call from Attorney General Merrick Garland asking him to serve as the special counsel overseeing the investigation into classified documents found at a home and former office of President Biden. It was a request Mr. Hur told associates he didn’t feel he could refuse, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMr. Hur accepted the appointment clear-eyed about the reputational risks of taking on an investigation into a sitting president, according to people familiar with his considerations, especially as a separate special counsel investigates former President Donald Trump over his handling of classified documents found at his South Florida residence and private club, Mar-a-Lago.\nMr. Hur is expected to begin as special counsel at the end of January after winding down his work at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, the law firm he joined as a partner in 2021 after serving as the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Maryland. For Mr. Hur, the appointment entails leaving behind what promised to be a lucrative client in the NFL, which had turned to him to defend against a lawsuit brought by the Washington, D.C., attorney general.\n“This was clearly not a financially motivated decision,” said Rod Rosenstein, who served as deputy attorney general during the Trump administration and assigned Mr. Hur, at the time his top aide, to help oversee Robert Mueller’s special counsel inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. “Rob understands what he is getting into,” Mr. Rosenstein said. \nPresident Biden said Thursday that a “small number” of classified documents from his time as vice president were found at his home and in his personal library. Attorney General Merrick Garland outlined the decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate. Photo: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\nGibson Dunn explored a leave-of-absence arrangement to keep Mr. Hur affiliated with the firm, but the Justice Department rejected the idea, in part out of concern for potential conflicts of interest in what is expected to be a monthslong investigation, a person familiar with the discussions said.  \nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. In a statement, Gibson Dunn partner F. Joseph Warin said Mr. Hur “has excelled in every professional endeavor, and we are confident that he will discharge his responsibilities as Special Counsel with the same impeccable judgment and tireless work ethic that he has exhibited throughout his career.”\nIn Mr. Hur, the attorney general picked a Justice Department veteran with experience in the George W. Bush and Trump administrations and political savvy, former colleagues said. During his tenure as U.S. attorney for Maryland, Mr. Hur’s office handled several high-profile cases and secured a conviction against former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh on fraud and tax charges.\nMr. Hur’s return to the Justice Department comes just weeks after he entered his initial court appearance to defend the NFL and its commissioner, Roger Goodell, against a consumer-protection lawsuit alleging that the league and the Washington Commanders team deceived Washington, D.C., residents about their investigation into a “toxic workplace culture that impacted employees, especially women.”\nThe Washington attorney general’s office accuses the league of misleading the public by withholding the full findings of that investigation, which the team initiated before the league took over the inquiry. The league, the attorney general’s office said, had made promises of a transparent and independent investigation. \nAn NFL spokesman said when the lawsuit was filed in November that it was “legally unsound and factually baseless” and defended the league’s investigation.\nNational Football League commissioner Roger Goodell is a defendant in a lawsuit in which Robert Hur had been set to represent him. PHOTO: MATT KROHN/USA TODAY SPORTS\nOne of Mr. Hur’s first tasks as special counsel will be to decide whether to escalate the investigation into how and why documents with classified markings made their way to an office Mr. Biden used at the Penn Biden Center in Washington and at his home in Wilmington, Del., people familiar with the matter said. That could include more invasive steps such as having the Federal Bureau of Investigation, rather than Mr. Biden’s legal team, search the president’s properties for additional documents, they said. \nAfter the initial discovery of classified documents in November, the Justice Department considered having agents monitor a search by Mr. Biden’s lawyers for the material but decided against it, in part to preserve their freedom to take a tougher line later, including by executing a future search warrant, if negotiations ever turned hostile, people familiar with the matter said. The approach signaled that investigators are considering the possibility of a grand jury investigation into the matter.\nMr. Hur also could ask Mr. Biden’s team for consent to have the FBI search the homes and office themselves, a step law-enforcement officials have already discussed, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Trump, for his part, has continued to argue that the revelations about the Justice Department’s stance toward Mr. Biden point to a bias against him, considering how his home was subject to an August FBI search. “Why aren’t they raiding his house?” the former president wrote Wednesday on his social media platform. \nIn an effort to explain the discovery of empty folders marked classified at his property, he said they were distributed in the Oval Office, and while the papers inside were collected after review, the folders weren’t. “I saved hundreds of them,” Mr. Trump wrote, adding he viewed the folders as a “cool keepsake.” \nInvestigators say they retrieved hundreds of pages of documents from Mr. Trump’s property in a search that followed months of government attempts to get the records back and Mr. Trump’s legal team failing to fully comply with a May subpoena.\nThe political risks to Mr. Biden were evident in a new Quinnipiac University poll, with 60% of respondents saying the president acted inappropriately in the way he handled the documents. Seventy-one percent said the discovery was either very serious or somewhat serious while 24% said it is either not too serious or not serious at all. Forty-six percent think Mr. Biden shouldn’t face criminal charges, according to the poll, while 37% think he should.\n—Louise Radnofsky and Alex Leary contributed to this article.\nCorrections & Amplifications Goodell was a plaintiff in the suit.\nNational Football League commissioner Roger Goodell is a defendant in a lawsuit in which attorney Robert Hur had been set to represent him.

Frank. Kendall last week said he was looking at a prototype for a blended-wing transport aircraft. Boeing hasn't developed an all-new plane since the 787. Dreamliner in the early s, and. Mr. Calhoun has said emerging technology such as more efficient engines don't support the business case for one now. \"There'll be a moment in time where we'll pull the rabbit out of the hat and introduce a new airplane sometime in the middle of the next decade,\" he said at an investor event in. November. Boeing and rival. Airbus. SE have a backlog of thousands of existing jetliners stretching out to almost a decade of production. Big aircraft buyers have said they support the aims of reducing the climate footprint of aircraft, though some have questioned the economics of unconventional designs. Secret. Purges,. Tense.

PHOTO: PETER CZIBORRA/REUTERS\nA federal judge is requiring Boeing Co. BA 1.41%\nincrease; green up pointing triangle\nto be arraigned on a previously settled criminal charge stemming from two crashes of its 737 MAX jets, and will allow accident victims’ relatives to speak in court about an agreement that allowed the aerospace company to avoid being indicted or pleading guilty.\nThe decision, handed down Thursday by U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, comes after the 737 MAX families had protested how the Trump administration’s Justice Department settled with Boeing BA 1.41%\nincrease; green up pointing triangle\nin January 2021. Under terms of the settlement, the company agreed to pay $2.5 billion and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement.\nRelatives of people who died in the 2018 and 2019 accidents have been challenging Boeing on multiple fronts, including in civil lawsuits and a recent lobbying fight related to new versions of the aircraft. The crashes took 346 lives.\nBoeing and the Justice Department declined to comment on Thursday. The judge’s ruling didn’t appear to immediately affect the 2021 settlement, but would require Boeing to undergo an arraignment, a procedural step that typically occurs at the outset of a prosecution. Boeing is expected to enter a plea.\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWhat’s News\nCatch up on the headlines, understand the news and make better decisions, free in your inbox daily. Enjoy a free article in every edition.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nThe families of the crash victims say their rights were violated by the Justice Department when it reached its settlement with the company, because they weren’t told about the deal in advance and weren’t given a chance to voice their opinions on it.\n“These families in that criminal process were denied their right to tell the court the impact that this had on them, and now they’re going to have a chance to do that,” said Chicago attorney Bob Clifford, who also represents MAX victims in a separate civil case.\nJudge O’Connor found in October that the family members are representatives of crime victims, giving them standing to question the settlement. Boeing agreed in its deal with federal prosecutors that two of its former employees misled federal air-safety regulators about how the MAX’s automated flight-control system worked. As part of the 2021 agreement, the plane maker was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S., but avoided prosecution on that charge as long as it stays out of legal trouble for a period of three years.\nJudge O’Connor on Thursday ruled that Boeing should be formally arraigned in court, where the family members will be allowed to speak about the settlement. Arraignments typically involve a defendant entering a plea of guilty or not guilty against charges filed against them.\nJudge O’Connor set the arraignment for 9 a.m. CT on Jan. 26 at the Fort Worth federal courthouse.\nThe judge’s ruling on Thursday didn’t address other requests by the MAX families, including to rescind certain provisions of the Justice Department’s agreement with Boeing that limit further criminal actions related to the case.\nThe Justice Department had early last year opposed an arraignment for Boeing, but in November switched its position with the court and said it would support allowing the families to be heard at an arraignment.\nThe families had complained that Justice Department officials didn’t confer with them before reaching the 2021 deferred prosecution agreement with Boeing. Attorney General Merrick Garland, President Biden’s appointee to lead the Justice Department, met with some of the families, and federal prosecutors later apologized but had argued the families weren’t crime victims under U.S. law.\nWrite to Andrew Tangel at andrew.tangel@wsj.com and Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com\nAdvertisement\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nRECOMMENDED VIDEOS",

         "Boeing 737. MAX. Families. May. Weigh. In on. DOJ's. Criminal. Settlement,. Judge. Rules 4 min. The families of. Boeing's 737. Max crash victims might weigh in on a previous settlement with the. Justice. Department. to be arraigned on a previously settled criminal charge stemming from two crashes of its 737. MAX jets, and will allow accident victims' relatives to speak in court about an agreement that allowed the aerospace company to avoid being indicted or pleading guilty. The decision, handed down. Thursday by. U.S. District. Judge. Reed. O'Connor in. Fort. Worth,. Texas, comes after the 737. MAX families had protested how the. Trump administration's. Justice. Department settled with. Boeing. BA 1.41 increase; green up pointing triangle in. January . Under terms of the settlement, the company agreed to pay 2.5 billion and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement. Relatives of people who died in the and accidents have been challenging. Boeing on multiple fronts, including in civil lawsuits and a recent lobbying fight related to new versions of the aircraft. The crashes took 346 lives. Boeing and the. Justice. Department declined to comment on. Thursday. The judge's ruling didn't appear to immediately affect the settlement, but would require. Boeing to undergo an arraignment, a procedural step that typically occurs at the outset of a prosecution. Boeing is expected to enter a plea. The families of the crash victims say their rights were violated. Department when it reached its settlement with the company, because they weren't told about the deal in advance and weren't given a chance to voice their opinions on it. \"These families in that criminal process were denied their right to tell the court the impact that this had on them, and now they're going to have a chance to do that,\" said. Chicago attorney. Bob. Clifford, who also represents. MAX victims in a separate civil case. Judge. O'Connor found in. October that the family members are representatives of crime victims, giving them standing to question the settlement. Boeing agreed in its deal with federal prosecutors that two of its former employees misled federal air-safety regulators about how the. MAX's automated flight-control system worked. As part of the agreement, the plane maker was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the. U.S., but avoided prosecution on that charge as long as it stays out of legal trouble for a period of three years. Judge. O'Connor on. Thursday ruled that. Boeing should be formally arraigned in court, where the family members will be allowed to speak about the settlement. Arraignments typically involve a defendant entering a plea of guilty or not guilty against charges filed against them. Judge. O'Connor set the arraignment for 9 a.m. CT on. Jan. 26 at the. Fort. Worth federal courthouse. The judge's ruling on. Thursday didn't address other requests families, including to rescind certain provisions of the. Justice. Department's agreement with. Boeing that limit further criminal actions related to the case. The. Justice. Department had early last year opposed an arraignment for. Boeing, but in. November switched its position with the court and said it would support allowing the families to be heard at an arraignment. The families had complained that. Justice. Department officials didn't confer with them before reaching the deferred prosecution agreement with. Boeing. Attorney. General. Merrick. Garland,. President. Biden's appointee to lead the. Justice. Department, met with some of the families, and federal prosecutors later apologized but had argued the families weren't crime victims under. U.S. law. Secret. Purges,. Tense. Standoffs. The. War.

         "Title: Tim Kaine Says He Will Run for Third Senate Term\n\nAdvertisement\nPOLITICS\nELECTIONS\nTim Kaine Says He Will Run for Third Senate Term\nNews could boost Democrats’ hopes of keeping control of the chamber\nBy\nNatalie Andrews\n11\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(4 min)\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, pictured Friday in Richmond, was first elected to the Senate in 2012. PHOTO: JOHN C. CLARK/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said he would run for a third term, providing his party a boost ahead of what is expected to be a tough 2024 campaign to keep control of the chamber. \n“I’m a servant, I love Virginia, I’m proud of what I’ve done, and I’ve got a whole lot more I want to do,” he said at a press conference in Richmond, Va. \nMr. Kaine, 64 years old, served as mayor of Richmond, and later as Virginia’s governor. He was first elected to the Senate in 2012 and won re-election in 2018. His profile was elevated in 2016 when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton chose him to be her vice presidential running mate. \nWhile Virginia is considered a competitive state, Mr. Kaine handily won re-election by a 15-point margin in 2018 against Republican Corey Stewart, a former Prince William County executive. Democrat Joe Biden won the presidential race by 10 points in 2020, but the state elected Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears in 2021 the following year. \nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWSJ Politics & Policy\nScoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nMr. Youngkin, who is limited to one term by state law, is also seen as a potential 2024 Senate candidate or presidential candidate. Ms. Sears and state Attorney General Jason Miyares could also look at the Senate or governor race. Some House Republicans could pursue statewide office, such as freshman Rep. Jen Kiggans. \nThe Democratic caucus, which includes three independents who align with the party, currently has a 51-49 majority in the Senate. But Democrats are defending far more seats than Republicans in 2024. Earlier this month, Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D., Mich.) said she won’t seek re-election, potentially easing the way for Republicans to flip that seat.\nDemocrats breathed a sigh of relief that Mr. Kaine was running for another term, after he had held off on committing to another run and as he continues to suffer long-term symptoms from Covid-19. He said party leaders encouraged him to run again.\nHe said that despite the split control of Congress, he could see some progress on immigration laws, mental health and addiction.\n“Is it going to be tougher the next couple of years? Yes, it will be,” he said at his press conference. “But are there meaningful things that can be done and done in a bipartisan way? I believe so,” he said.\nMr. Kaine has been a reliable Democratic vote in the Senate. In his announcement, he touted his work on transportation projects such as highway improvements and the Metro Silver Line in Northern Virginia, as well as his work on foreign affairs and helping military families and veterans.\nIn recent months, he opposed efforts by Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) to push through a provision approving the Mountain Valley Pipeline in West Virginia and Virginia as part of his stalled permitting overhaul proposal. He has worked with Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) on compromise legislation that would codify the rights to abortion recognized in the now-defunct 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and related rulings.

PHOTO: ANNE KAURANEN/REUTERS\nShares in the owner of the “Angry Birds” mobile game franchise soared Friday after it said it had received a 751 million euro takeover proposal, equivalent to $813.5 million, from a rival developer, as a slowdown in the games industry spurs consolidation.\nRovio Entertainment Oyj, which helped pioneer the mobile-gaming industry, said the 9.05 euro-a-share bid from Israel’s Playtika PLTK -0.50%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\nHolding Corp. represented a sweetened offer, following an earlier, undisclosed 8.50 euro bid from the company.\nThe Finnish company said it wasn’t presently engaged in talks with Playtika but would evaluate the proposal and determine how to proceed. Rovio’s shares jumped 40% in early trading to 7.96 euros, before falling back slightly.\nPlaytika specializes in casino-style mobile games, though it has recently added casual games akin to “Angry Birds” to its stable through a series of acquisitions.\nIn a statement, Playtika said it believed the combination of Rovio’s intellectual property and user base, together with its monetization and game operation capabilities, would create value for shareholders.\nSimple yet addictive, “Angry Birds” was a trailblazing mobile game released in 2009 when smartphones and the mobile-gaming industry they enabled were still in their infancy. Players use a slingshot to fire their birds over, under and through various obstacles to knock out squadrons of green pigs attempting to steal their eggs.\nThe title was the first mobile game to be downloaded 1 billion times, according to Rovio, which claimed last year to have reached the milestone of 5 billion downloads across its games catalog.\nRovio has built on the success of the original game by launching multiple sequels, as well as TV spin offs and a 2016 movie. It floated on the stock market in late 2017, hoping the listing would help its growth plans.\nHowever, Rovio has never managed to replicate the success of “Angry Birds” with its subsequent games titles and the aging franchise, while still popular, has itself been eclipsed in recent years by newer rivals.\nEven so, Rovio had a relatively strong 2022, reporting a 16% increase in revenues to 241 million euros in the first nine months of the year relative to the same period in 2021. Profits during the period were up 9% to 33 million euros, the company said.\nPlaytika’s move for Rovio comes amid a postpandemic slowdown in gaming. Revenues from mobile games declined 6.4% year-over-year to $92.2 billion in 2022, according to games industry data provider Newzoo. Mobile games account for half of all videogame revenues, and are worth as much as console, PC and online videogames combined, according to Newzoo.\nThe slowdown has helped drive a wave of consolidation in the industry, most notably in Microsoft Corp.’s proposed $75 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc.  \nPlaytika announced in December that it was laying off around 600 employees, equivalent to 15% of its total head count.\nDominic Chopping contributed to this article.\nAdvertisement\nWrite to Trefor Moss at Trefor.Moss@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 21, 2023, print edition as '‘Angry Birds’ Owner Rovio Receives Takeover Proposal'.\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nThey Paid $3,500 for Apple’s Vision Pro.
