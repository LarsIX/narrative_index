In their latest business model, trial lawyers are hired by state attorneys general to help prosecute public lawsuits then use it to the advantage of their private lawsuits. Kudos to one company for pushing back.\nIn December pharmacy benefit manager OptumRx filed a motion in federal court in Ohio to disqualify Motley Rice, a South Carolina plaintiffs firm suing the company in multidistrict opioid litigation. Motley has been retained by state attorneys general and city prosecutors in Washington, D.C., Hawaii and Chicago to handle the government’s litigation, but it continues to represent private clients in related litigation.\nThis double dipping would break the rules of professional conduct in nearly any industry, but it’s an open scandal in the tort business. In a typical arrangement, trial lawyers are hired as “special assistant attorneys general” on a given case, a designation that confers advantages during legal discovery. The lawyers then turn around and share information to benefit private lawsuits where they can make millions in contingency fees.\nIn its motion to disqualify Motley Rice, OptumRx notes that under the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct, lawyers are barred from knowingly having “confidential government information about a person, acquired when the lawyer was a public officer or employee” and from representing a “private client whose interests are adverse to that person.”\nIn its role working on state opioid lawsuits, Motley served subpoenas that required Optum to deliver what it called “wide swaths of confidential business records and testimony.” Faced with the government subpoenas, the company “produced thousands of pages of confidential information” and sent the documents “directly to Motley Rice.” With that information, Motley continued litigating its private cases against Optum and other pharmacy benefit managers on opioid matters.\nThe Optum motion, along with the consolidated opioid litigation, is before federal Judge Aaron Polster, who has pushed the parties to reach settlements. In a recent telephone hearing, Judge Polster is reported to have told OptumRx lawyer Brian Boone that he should think twice about filing the disqualification motion against the trial lawyers, whom he considers to be cooperative.\n“Your clients need to understand if they file these motions, it will be very difficult to maintain that level of professional cooperation, and that will clearly have negative repercussions for your clients,” Judge Polster said, according to Law360, a legal news website which got a transcript of the hearing. “I don’t need to spell it out. But if they’re not listening you ought to explain to them exactly what I mean.”\nThat’s loud and clear. Judge Polster is discouraging Optum’s lawyers from filing a motion that reflects poorly on Motley Rice. But if companies can’t challenge the trial lawyers’ alliance with state attorneys general, they are destined to be saddled with bills for the opioid epidemic regardless of legal liability. The opioid crisis is a tragedy with many causes, but using government authority for the enrichment of the trial bar is not a triumph of justice.\nAdvertisement\nJournal Editorial Report: Medicare's \"negotiation\" with pharmaceutical companies will slow the development of new cures.

The official English translation wrote “all Chinese” rather than “compatriots,” according to a Reuters dispatch.\nThe language comes 12 days before Taiwan’s voters go to the polls in a hotly contested three-way race for President. Chinese propaganda is working hard against front-runner Lai Ching-te, the current vice president and presidential nominee of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Mr. Lai and his party are obstacles to coerced reunification.\nOne big question for the New Year is how does China react if Mr. Lai wins? Does Mr. Xi tell his military to increase its harassment of Taiwan airspace and waters? Or, with two hot wars around the word and an election year in the U.S. that is likely to be highly divisive, will he try something more daring?\nThe White House thinks its recent parlays with Beijing have put U.S.-China bilateral relations on a more stable course. Perhaps that’s right. But it’s worth recalling that, in the Chinese Lunar Calendar, 2024 is the Year of the Dragon, and to prepare accordingly.\nAdvertisement\nWSJ Opinion: Our Predictions for 2024\nPlay video: WSJ Opinion: Our Predictions for 2024\nJournal Editorial Report: Best guesses of what's to come from Kim Strassel, Bill McGurn and Dan Henninger.

Chinese\" rather than \"compatriots,\" according to a. Reuters dispatch. The language comes 12 days before. Taiwan's voters go to the polls in a hotly contested three-way race for. President. Chinese propaganda is working hard against front-runner. Lai. Ching-te, the current vice president and presidential nominee of the ruling. Democratic. Progressive and his party are obstacles to coerced reunification. One big question for the. New. Year is how does. China react if. Mr. Lai wins? Does. Mr. Xi tell his military to increase its harassment of. Taiwan airspace and waters? Or, with two hot wars around the word and an election year in the. U.S. that is likely to be highly divisive, will he try something more daring? The. White. House thinks its recent parlays with. Beijing have put. U.S.-China bilateral relations on a more stable course. Perhaps that's right. But it's worth recalling that, in the. Chinese. Lunar. Calendar, is the. Year of the. Dragon, and to prepare accordingly.

         "Advertisement\nWORLD\nMIDDLE EAST\nIsrael’s Highest Court Strikes Down Controversial Law to Curb Its Power\nThe law was centerpiece of judicial overhaul pursued by Netanyahu’s government before Gaza war erupted\nBy Carrie Keller-Lynn and\nAnat Peled\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 1, 2024 4:17 pm ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(7 min)\nIsrael’s Supreme Court has struck down a law passed in July that would have taken away the court’s powers to abrogate government decisions it deems to be ‘unreasonable in the extreme.’ PHOTO: DEBBIE HILL/REUTERS\nTEL AVIV—Israel’s highest court has struck down a controversial judicial overhaul law enacted last year by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that would have limited the justices’ power.\nWhile the broader overhaul sparked some of the worst political and social strife in Israel in years, political leaders—including Netanyahu and his allies—have signaled that they will not fight Monday’s ruling while the country is embroiled in a devastating war in Gaza.\nThe law, which was passed in July and was akin to a constitutional amendment, would have taken away the court’s powers to abrogate government decisions it deems to be “unreasonable in the extreme.”\nEight justices ruled in favor of striking down the law, with seven against it.\nThe ruling comes with the country still reeling from the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities.\nBefore the attack, hundreds of thousands of Israelis came out weekly to protest against Netanyahu’s push to weaken the powers of the court.\nAnalysts say Monday’s ruling could have substantial consequences for postwar domestic politics, including any inquiry into the intelligence failures leading up to Oct. 7.\nThe ruling could eventually reignite a divisive national debate and provoke a constitutional crisis. And if Netanyahu seeks to overturn the ruling in the short term, it could cause cracks to form within the multiparty emergency coalition formed to lead the country during the war.\nBut for the moment, Israelis are focused on the war effort.\nThousands of Israelis took part in a protest march last July against the judicial overhaul plans. PHOTO: ABIR SULTAN/SHUTTERSTOCK\n“The public doesn’t care about the judicial thing so much anymore,” said Barak Medina, a legal scholar and professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\nGroups that led the protests against the judicial overhaul welcomed the ruling but said a return to prewar divisions during the conflict was unlikely. “We are in the midst of the longest and most horrible war in our history,” said Lee Hoffman Agiv, of the protest group Bonot Alternativa, or Building an Alternative. “There won’t be celebrations here.”\nThe law was part of a broader package of legislation aimed at limiting the court’s power and giving more control to lawmakers. Netanyahu has argued that activist, liberal judges control the court and that the legislation seeks to restore a proper balance of power. Opponents charge that the legislation would undermine the court’s role as a check on executive and legislative power and would erode Israel’s liberal democracy.\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWhat’s News\nCatch up on the headlines, understand the news and make better decisions, free in your inbox daily.

Since the mid-1990s, the court has interpreted them as the country’s constitution.\nIn a decision that could have wide repercussions, the court also ruled 12-3 that it has the right to strike down a basic law in “unusual and extreme cases” when it goes against the core principles of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.\n“This is really an unprecedented decision because it is the first time in the history of the state where the court strikes down a basic law” that is equivalent to a constitutional amendment, said Yaniv Roznai, a law professor at Reichman University in central Israel.\nThe court had never before struck down one of the basic laws, but had opined in various decisions that it had the authority to do so if the laws would alter the basic democratic character of the country.\nNetanyahu’s Likud party criticized the court’s ruling, saying that “it is unfortunate that the Supreme Court chose to issue a decision at the heart of Israel’s social divisions, precisely when [Israeli] soldiers” from across the political spectrum “are fighting and risking their lives.”\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sought to limit the court’s powers and give more control to the elected government. PHOTO: ABIR SULTAN/SHUTTERSTOCK\nJustice Minister Yariv Levin, considered the judicial overhaul’s chief architect, said the court’s ruling “takes away from millions of citizens their vote and the basic right to be equal partners in decision-making.” Levin has long argued that elected leaders should have more influence over the courts and their authority.\nOpposition Leader Yair Lapid praised the decision as protecting Israeli democracy. “If the Israeli government again starts the fight over the Supreme Court,” Lapid said, then “they learned nothing on Oct. 7.”\nThe Netanyahu government’s judicial overhaul plan divided the country before the war, with some arguing that it conveyed weakness to Israel’s enemies and influenced the timing of the Hamas attack.\nAdvertisement\nThe ruling coalition has several options if it chooses to oppose the ruling, say legal analysts. This includes passing a more nuanced version of the reasonableness amendment or passing basic law legislation that would limit the ability of the court to strike down basic laws.\nPresident Biden had urged Netanyahu to slow down and seek a consensus with the political opposition on changes to the country’s Supreme Court.\nMonday’s ruling comes at a critical time for Netanyahu, who has faced blowback at home about Israel’s failure to prevent Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks. The longtime leader has pushed back, saying that questions about his personal responsibility would be dealt with in a postwar inquiry.\nWithout Monday’s ruling, courts would have little recourse to force the government to create a state commission of inquiry into Israel’s intelligence failures, said Medina, the law professor. Only a state commission of inquiry can issue recommendations with serious weight, he added.\nIf Netanyahu takes steps to oppose the top court’s ruling, it could undermine the working of the emergency government that was formed after the Oct. 7 attack.\nFormer Defense Minister Benny Gantz, who leads the National Unity alliance, was against the judicial overhaul. If Gantz leaves the war cabinet, Netanyahu’s coalition, widely viewed as the most right-wing, nationalist and religious in the country’s 75-year history, would be in charge of making decisions about the war. The emergency government was formed to establish some unity in the country after a period of polarization in Israeli society and politics.\n“The verdict must be respected, and the lesson from the conduct of the last year must be internalized—we are brothers, we all have a common destiny,” Gantz said after the ruling was announced.\nConflict in the Middle East\nLatest news and key analysis, selected by editors\nChallenge to Hamas in Gaza Grows as Protests Enter Second Day\nPalestinian Film Director Released After Being Attacked by Israeli Settlers\nIsrael Is Killing Hamas Leaders in Quick Succession\nIn Gaza, Weddings Are Off and Restaurants Close Again as Cease-Fire Crumbles\nTurkey Detains Erdogan’s Top Rival in Raid on Opposition\nIsrael, Fighting Again in Gaza, Is Also at War at Home\nTrump’s Yemen Campaign Tests Promise to Avoid Forever Wars\nSyria to Integrate U.S.-Backed Kurdish Militia Into Armed Forces\nAppeared in the January 2, 2024, print edition as 'Israeli Justices Overturn Divisive Court Law'.\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nMarine Le Pen Found Guilty of Embezzlement, Banned From Next Election\nIf Vaccines Don’t Cause Autism, What Does?\nMike Waltz Is Losing Support Inside the White House\nNo More Mr. Nice Guy.

         "7 min. Israel's. Supreme. Court has struck down a law passed in. July that would have taken away the court's powers to abrogate government decisions it deems to be 'unreasonable in the extreme.'. TEL. AVIVIsrael's highest court has struck down a controversial judicial overhaul law enacted last year of. Prime. Minister. Benjamin. Netanyahu that would have limited the justices' power. While the broader overhaul sparked some of the worst political and social strife in. Israel in years, political leadersincluding. Netanyahu and his allieshave signaled that they will not fight. Monday's ruling while the country is embroiled in a devastating war in. Gaza. The law, which was passed in. July and was akin to a constitutional amendment, would have taken away the court's powers to abrogate government decisions it deems to be \"unreasonable in the extreme.\". Eight justices ruled in favor of striking down the law, with seven against it. The ruling comes with the country still reeling from the. Oct. 7 attack on southern. Israel that killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to. Israeli authorities. Before the attack, hundreds of thousands of. Israelis came out weekly to protest against. Netanyahu's push to weaken the powers of the court. Analysts say. Monday's ruling could have substantial consequences for postwar domestic politics, including any inquiry into the intelligence failures leading up to. Oct. 7. The ruling could eventually reignite a divisive national debate and provoke a constitutional crisis. And if. Netanyahu seeks to overturn the ruling in the short term, it could cause cracks to form within the multiparty emergency coalition formed to lead the country during the war. But for the moment,. Israelis are focused on the war effort. Thousands of. Israelis took part in a protest march last. July against the judicial overhaul plans. \"The public doesn't care about the judicial thing so much anymore,\" said. Barak. Medina, a legal scholar and professor at the. Hebrew. University of. Jerusalem. Groups that led the protests against the judicial overhaul welcomed the ruling but said a return to prewar divisions during the conflict was unlikely. \"We are in the midst of the longest and most horrible war in our history,\" said. Lee. Hoffman. Agiv, of the protest group. Bonot. Alternativa, or. Building an. Alternative. \"There won't be celebrations here.\". The law was part of a broader package of legislation aimed at limiting the court's power and giving more control to lawmakers. Netanyahu has argued that activist, liberal judges control the court and that the legislation seeks to restore a proper balance of power. Opponents charge that the legislation would undermine the court's role as a check on executive and legislative power and would erode. Israel's liberal democracy. Israel has no written constitution like the. U.S. and relies on a series of basic laws, which have special, quasi-constitutional status and delineate the basic tenets of the state such as electoral procedures, minting currency, and individual rights. Since the mid-s, the court has interpreted them as the country's constitution. In a decision that could have wide repercussions, the court also ruled 12-3 that it has the right to strike down a basic law in \"unusual and extreme cases\" when it goes against the core principles of. Israel as a. Jewish and democratic state. \"This is really an unprecedented decision because it is the first time in the history of the state where the court strikes down a basic law\" that is equivalent to a constitutional amendment, said. Yaniv. Roznai, a law professor at. Reichman. University in central. Israel. The court had never before struck down one of the basic laws, but had opined in various decisions that it had the authority to do so if the laws would alter the basic democratic character of the country. Netanyahu's. Likud party criticized the court's ruling, saying that \"it is unfortunate that the. Supreme. Court chose to issue a decision at the heart of. Israel's social divisions, precisely when. Israeli soldiers\" from across the political spectrum \"are fighting and risking their lives.\". Prime. Minister. Benjamin. Netanyahu has sought to limit the court's powers and give more control to the elected government. Justice. Minister. Yariv. Levin, considered the judicial overhaul's chief architect, said the court's ruling \"takes away from millions of citizens their vote and the basic right to be equal partners in decision-making.\". Levin has long argued that elected leaders should have more influence over the courts and their authority. Opposition. Leader. Yair. Lapid praised the decision as protecting. Israeli democracy. \"If the. Israeli government again starts the fight over the. Supreme. Court,\". Lapid said, then \"they learned nothing on. Oct. 7.\". The. Netanyahu government's judicial overhaul plan divided the country before the war, with some arguing that it conveyed weakness to. Israel's enemies and influenced the timing of the. Hamas attack. The ruling coalition has several options if it chooses to oppose the ruling, say legal analysts. This includes passing a more nuanced version of the reasonableness amendment or passing basic law legislation that would limit the ability of the court to strike down basic laws. President. Biden had urged. Netanyahu to slow down and seek a consensus with the political opposition on changes to the country's. Supreme. Court. Monday's ruling comes at a critical time for. Netanyahu, who has faced blowback at home about. Israel's failure to prevent. Hamas's. Oct. 7 attacks. The longtime leader has pushed back, saying that questions about his personal responsibility would be dealt with in a postwar inquiry. Without. Monday's ruling, courts would have little recourse to force the government to create a state commission of inquiry into. Israel's intelligence failures, said. Medina, the law professor. Only a state commission of inquiry can issue recommendations with serious weight, he added. If. Netanyahu takes steps to oppose the top court's ruling, it could undermine the working of the emergency government that was formed after the. Oct. 7 attack. Former. Defense. Minister. Benny. Gantz, who leads the. National. Unity alliance, was against the judicial overhaul. If. Gantz leaves the war cabinet,. Netanyahu's coalition, widely viewed as the most right-wing, nationalist and religious in the country's 75-year history, would be in charge of making decisions about the war. The emergency government was formed to establish some unity in the country after a period of polarization in. Israeli society and politics. \"The verdict must be respected, and the lesson from the conduct of the last year must be internalizedwe are brothers, we all have a common destiny,\". Gantz said after the ruling was announced. Latest news and key analysis, selected. More. Mr. Nice. Guy. In. Fighting. Trump,. Canada. Presents 'Mr. Elbows.'",

         "Advertisement\nOPINION\nMAIN STREET\nMaking Discrimination OK Again\nThe losers in a 2020 California referendum are back again with a sneakier version.\nBy\nWilliam McGurn\nFollow\nJan. 1, 2024 2:55 pm ET\n649\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(5 min)\nPHOTO: UNCREDITED\nDo they ever give up? Those looking to divvy up Americans by race, that is.\nIn California they tried to get race preferences approved in a 2020 referendum, but voters rejected it 57.2% to 42.8%. This was a stunning rebuke, not only because the rejection came from residents of a blue state but because the losing side had outspent opponents something like 14 to 1.\nIn 2023 the Supreme Court weighed in with a landmark ruling that barred colleges from treating people as members of a racial group instead of as individuals—and cast constitutional doubt on all race-based preferences. “Eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. Couldn’t be clearer, right?\nNot in California. Undaunted state Assemblyman Corey Jackson is pushing a bill called ACA7. It takes aim at the state ban on race preferences that voters put in the constitution in 1996 when they passed Proposition 209. Californians reaffirmed Proposition 209 three years ago at the ballot box.\nThe language the voters agreed to and the activists hate reads as follows: “The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.”\nUnlike the 2020 effort, the new bill would leave that language intact. Instead, it would add a provision allowing the governor to create “exceptions.” Effectively that would gut the ban.\nApparently, the lesson the advocates of state-sponsored discrimination have taken from their defeat is that if at first you don’t succeed, try something sneakier.\nHere is Mr. Jackson’s press release summarizing the bill: “ACA7 will allow . . . the Governor to issue waivers to public agencies that wish to use state funds for research-based, or research-informed and culturally specific interventions to increase life expectancy, improve educational outcomes, and lift people out of poverty for specific ethnic groups and marginalized genders.”\nGail Heriot is a University of San Diego law professor who sits on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and was a leader of both Proposition 209 and the “no” effort on the 2020 referendum. She has launched a petition with Extremely Concerned Californians at change.org opposing the measure.\n“ACA7’s proponents are hoping that voters will be fooled into thinking that it is just a small exception,” Ms. Heriot says. “In fact, it gives the governor enormous power to nullify Proposition 209.”\nEdward Blum agrees. As the founder of Students for Fair Admissions, he spearheaded the lawsuits against Harvard and the University of North Carolina that killed race preferences in college admissions.\n“Racial preferences are never legally justified because some specious ‘research’ report concludes it would be beneficial to a certain race,” says Mr. Blum. “This exemption will trigger endless litigation that will polarize California citizens by race.”\nBut sowing discord is a feature, not a bug. As the bill was making its way through the Assembly, Mr. Jackson got in a spat with Bill Essayli—a Republican who is also the first Muslim elected to the Assembly. Mr. Essayli pointed out that the majority of Californian voters disagree with state-sanctioned discrimination. “I fundamentally disagree with this backwards policy,” he later tweeted.\nMr. Jackson responded in his own tweet: “This is a perfect example how a minority can become a white supremacist by doing everything possible to win white supremacist and fascist affection.”\nACA7 passed the state Assembly in September. If it passes the Senate, it will be on the ballot in November. If Californians vote yea, it will become part of the constitution.\nBut all is not lost. The 2020 referendum awakened a sleeping giant: the Asian-American community. Asian-Americans quickly realized (as the Harvard case drove home) that they and their children are the primary victims whenever race is substituted for merit. Asian-Americans are more aware and organized than they were in 2020. They aren’t likely to be fooled by talk of “exceptions” based on “research.”\nIt also isn’t a given that ACA7 will make it through the state Senate. Though Democrats enjoy a 32-8 majority, polls consistently show race preferences are unpopular. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s support will be crucial.\nThough he has no formal role in the constitutional process, some think the bill will go nowhere if Mr. Newsom doesn’t want it to. If it does make it to the ballot this November, he’ll be under immense pressure to endorse it. That’s another reason the Senate should kill ACA7 now, Ms. Heriot says.\n“California voters need to make sure their state senators know where they stand—through emails, phone calls, letters, and petitions,” Ms. Heriot says. “Once the senators understand that, they will realize putting ACA7 on the ballot is not in their interest.”\nWrite to mcgurn@wsj.com\nAdvertisement\nJournal Editorial Report: Colleges vow to keep race a factor in admissions.

         "Advertisement\nOPINION\nCOMMENTARY\nFollow\nDoes Biden Want Ukraine to Win?\nBy not arming Kyiv for a long-range campaign against Russia, the U.S. seems to be forcing a deal.\nBy Phillips P. O’Brien\nJan. 1, 2024 2:53 pm ET\n827\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(6 min)\nU.S. troops launch Himars during joint exercises in East Java, Indonesia, Sept. 11, 2023. PHOTO: JUNI KRISWANTO/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nPresident Biden on Friday denounced Russia for having “launched its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since this war began.” The attack used some 158 missiles and drones to hit targets throughout the country. “It is a stark reminder to the world,” Mr. Biden said, that Vladimir Putin “seeks to obliterate Ukraine and subjugate its people. He must be stopped.”\nYet while Russia can strike anywhere in Ukraine, the U.S. has denied the Ukrainians the weapons they need to hit Russian targets, even in the parts of Ukraine that Russia occupies. This raises the question: Does Mr. Biden want Ukraine to win?\nHe has spoken about standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine, about helping the country “for as long as it takes” and about not letting Mr. Putin win. But the administration has never made a clear commitment to a Ukrainian victory—to helping the country liberate all its legally recognized territory and become part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\nPerhaps the reason for this reluctance is obvious: The Biden administration doesn’t want Ukraine to win. Instead, there are signs the administration wants to force a sordid deal on Kyiv, one in which Ukrainians hand over large parts of their country, including Crimea, to Mr. Putin. The best evidence of this is that the administration has bent over backward not to supply Ukraine with the weapons needed to hit Russian targets in Crimea.\nWhile the U.S. has pumped about $50 billion of weaponry into Ukraine, what it has given is rather one-dimensional. Washington has mostly sent weapons of limited range (howitzers, artillery, fighting vehicles and ammunition) and defensive weapons such as Patriot antiair systems. The administration has temporized about sending longer-range weapons, even though the U.S. has large stocks of them.\nOne example is the limited way the U.S. has supplied Ukraine with Himars ammunition. First appearing on the battlefield in early summer 2022, U.S.-made Himars, an acronym for High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, showed their value with great accuracy and punch. Ukraine used Himars to devastate Russian ammunition and supply depots, helping stop the Russian army in its tracks and leading to the liberation of much Ukrainian territory around Kharkiv and Kherson.\nYet the administration limited the type of Himars ammunition it provided, making sure the Ukrainians could attack Russian forces only within about 50 miles of the front—leaving Crimea off-limits. Predictably, after a few weeks of seeing their depots exploding, the Russians moved their supply points more than 50 miles from the front, many to Crimea. The Ukrainians had no way to hit them.\nThe administration’s action had to be deliberate, as the U.S. has significant stores of Himars ammunition, known as ATACMS (for Army Tactical Missile Systems), which could reach targets in the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine. No matter how often the Ukrainians asked for ATACMS, the answer was, until recently, no.\nFinally in October, the U.S. sent Ukraine around 20 ATACMS. Ukraine used them against Russian military helicopters and other targets that had been out of range. However far too few ATACMS were sent. After a handful of successful operations, Ukraine seems to have run out.\nIn depriving the Ukrainians of the ability to mount a sustained, long-range campaign against Russia, the administration is leaving Kyiv without the capability it needs to win. The ground war at the front in 2023 has made it clear that direct advances against prepared defensive positions are almost impossible. Both in the spring around the city of Bakhmut and in the autumn around Avdiivka, the Russians made very slow progress at the cost of mass casualties and crippling equipment losses. The Ukrainians, when supplied with Western tanks and vehicles, struggled to advance this summer.\nIn comparison, long-range weapons have been very effective. In 2023 the U.K. and France sent Ukraine a few hundred of their Storm Shadow/Scalp cruise missiles. The systems are similar but have different names. These missiles enabled Ukrainians to hit targets anywhere in Crimea and to neuter Russian naval power in the peninsula.\nThe Storm Shadow/Scalps played a crucial role in the Ukrainian attack on Sevastopol in September. Sevastopol was the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, and Moscow considered it relatively safe. Within moments, fire rained down on the base, damaging two major warships so badly that they haven’t operated since. Last week the Ukrainians used Storm Shadow/Scalps to sink the landing ship Novocherkassk in Crimea.\nThe attack underscores Crimea’s vulnerability to long-range fire. Only the Kerch Bridge connects it to Russia. As the Russians are being driven from the naval bases, they will become almost entirely reliant on the bridge. If the Ukrainians could stop movement across it, Russian rule over Crimea would be threatened. The U.S. has many systems in addition to ATACMS, such as Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles, that could help, but it isn’t offering them.\nArming Ukraine with long-range systems would help Ukraine liberate Crimea and end the war sooner, saving lives on both sides. An administration that wants Ukraine to win should see that and act accordingly. If the Biden administration continues to hem and haw, after all we have seen in recent months, we can stop asking whether it wants Ukraine to win the war. The answer would be no.\nMr. O’Brien is a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland.\nAdvertisement\nThe '2023 Reagan National Defense Survey' highlights China as the greatest national security threat to the U.S. and finds strong support for arming Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

The bad news is that it hasn’t slowed the military buildup in Beijing, which increasingly appears to be on a wartime footing. The U.S. needs to do likewise and reassemble what President Franklin D. Roosevelt referred to as the nation’s “arsenal of democracy.”\nChinese leaders have articulated a long-term national strategy to achieve the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts,” including developing a world-class military. Over the past decade, the Chinese Communist Party has ramped up defense industrial production and significantly improved its process of researching, developing and producing advanced weapons systems. As Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall III recently observed, China is preparing “specifically for a war with the U.S.”\nChina’s defense industrial efforts have strengthened its military capabilities. The People’s Liberation Army is amassing a formidable arsenal of medium- and long-range precision missiles capable of striking U.S. and allied bases in the Indo-Pacific. The PLA is also building a web of integrated air-defense systems to challenge U.S. forces in the region. Three of the world’s 10 largest defense companies are now Chinese enterprises: Aviation Industry Corp. of China, China North Industries Group and China South Industries Group.\nThe main beneficiary of China’s defense industrial growth is arguably the PLA’s navy. China is now the world’s largest shipbuilder by a significant margin. Its shipbuilding capacity is more than 230 times as large as the U.S.’s, allowing it to build 23 million tons of vessels, compared with less than 100,000 tons in the U.S. One Chinese shipyard, the Jiangnan Shipyard located on Changxing Island, has more capacity than all U.S. shipyards combined, according to U.S. Navy estimates.\nBeijing’s buildup should be a blinking red light for Washington. The U.S. defense industrial base lacks the capacity, responsiveness, flexibility and surge capability to meet the military’s needs. Part of the problem is that the U.S. defense industrial base remains on a peacetime footing, despite wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as growing tension in the Taiwan Strait and Korean Peninsula.\nThe U.S. faces a serious shortfall of munitions—especially long-range precision munitions—for a protracted war in the Indo-Pacific. That is owing in some part to Congress’s dragging its feet in fixing contracting problems, such as multiyear procurement. Supply-chain challenges remain serious, too, leading to an insufficient supply of solid rocket motors, ball bearings, microelectronics, and seekers for munitions. Today’s workforce is also inadequate to meet the demands of the defense industrial base.\nYet the U.S. private sector is the most innovative in the world, and it boasts a strong track record of revitalizing its defense industrial base during periods of crisis, such as during World War II and the Cold War. There is, however, a long way to go.\nA good place to start is at the White House. Presidents Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan established defense production boards to provide strategic guidance, oversee U.S. defense production, fix bureaucratic problems among executive agencies, and provide a sense of urgency. A national-level body is critical to oversee such a project of revitalization.\nThe Defense Department and Congress should also allocate additional funding and other enticements—such as tax incentives, regulatory relief and long-term contracts—to build and maintain production capacity. This funding could be used to modernize and expand defense facilities and develop flexible production. These steps will likely require an increase in defense spending. The U.S. is spending roughly 3% of its gross domestic product on defense, compared with 14% under Truman, 11% under Eisenhower, 9% under John F. Kennedy and more than 6% under Reagan.\nFDR in December 1940, a year before Pearl Harbor, implored the nation to revitalize its defense industry: “We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war.” We need to heed that advice again before it’s too late.\nMr. Jones is senior vice president and director of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nAdvertisement\nThe '2023 Reagan National Defense Survey' highlights China as the greatest national security threat to the U.S. and finds strong support for arming Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

PHOTO: DAVID PAUL MORRIS/BLOOMBERG NEWS\nIt didn’t get a lot of attention, but last month the White House awarded $3.1 billion to the California High-Speed Rail project. This was supposed to be a bullet train connecting San Francisco and Los Angeles in less than three hours. Instead, its costs keep rising even as the state scales back the plan. Since 2008, when California voters authorized a $10 billion bond issue for the train, they’ve been sold a bill of goods.\nThe original total estimated construction cost to taxpayers was $33 billion. That’s risen to at least $100 billion. The authority decided to offer service between San Francisco and Los Angeles in Phase I, then eventually extend the train service north to Sacramento and south to San Diego. Phase I was to have been completed by 2020.\nWithin five years of the bond approval, costs had soared so high that the California High-Speed Rail Authority had to adopt an emergency plan to contain them. One idea was to slow down the trains by having them share tracks with conventional commuter trains in parts of the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas. That reduced projected costs by billions of dollars—but made a mockery of the “high speed” rail claim.\nIn 2019 newly inaugurated Gov. Gavin Newsom declared that because of construction complications and cost overruns, the train would initially travel only down a 171-mile segment between Merced (a 130-mile drive from San Francisco) and Bakersfield (110 miles from Los Angeles). That segment was to cost $22.8 billion.\nThen the California High-Speed Rail Peer Review Committee dropped another bomb: The San Francisco to Los Angeles phase would take another 15 to 20 years to build, would cost three times as much as projected, and would be unable to meet legally mandated trip times.\nAbout the same time, the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office highlighted a $10 billion to $12 billion funding shortfall for the Merced-to-Bakersfield segment, though only a year before the California High-Speed Rail Authority’s 2022 Business Plan had said “revenues would be roughly equivalent to costs.” The federal grant will pay for less than one-third of the year’s cost overrun.\nIn legislative testimony, Louis S. Thompson, chairman of the Peer Review Committee, put the Phase I funding gap at $93 billion to $103 billion. He also noted there is at least an $8 billion increase that hasn’t been counted in the Southern California segment. “Even with a realistic share of new federal funding,” he said, “the project cannot get outside the Central Valley without added state or local funding.” The Legislative Analyst’s Office agreed.\nFuture cost escalation seems likely on the San Francisco and Los Angeles legs of Phase I, with massive tunneling through the Tehachapi Mountains toward Los Angeles and below the Coast Range toward San Francisco.\nThe committee concluded that “there is no existing federal program anywhere near the scale or sustaining level needed. There will need to be significant and sustained additional State funding on a predictable and adequate level.” But the Legislative Analysts’s Office has announced a $68 billion deficit, slamming that window shut for now—unless more federal money is on the way.\nMeanwhile, Florida has a new rail system up and running between Orlando and Miami, with all private financing. Florida also has a state budget surplus.\nMr. Cox is a senior fellow with the Committee to Unleash Prosperity and principal of Demographia, a St. Louis-area public-policy and transportation research firm.\nAdvertisement\nJournal Editorial Report: Best guesses of what's to come from Kim Strassel, Bill McGurn and Dan Henninger.

Mr. Selvarajah was up before 4, baking baguettes at his boulangerie next door. It’s called Au Levain des Pyrénées (Sourdough of the Pyrénées), the name given by its previous owner, from whom he bought it in 2021. He was at the Élysée Palace at 7 a.m. sharp, 50 baguettes in the back of his little white van. “I came to France from the war in Sri Lanka in 2005.

The 18 jurors prodded, sniffed, tasted and masticated before settling on a winning baguette. Mr. Selvarajah wept when he learned he’d won.\nThis Tamil man embodies a spirit of integration that the French yearn for in their immigrants, many of whom find it hard to embrace France as completely as Mr. Selvarajah has. “French people are good people,” he says. “They like you if you learn their culture.” He’s still Hindu—beholden to the deity Shiva—and speaks Tamil at home with his Sri Lankan-born wife.

As his French improved, he waited tables and befriended a customer—the owner of Au Levain des Pyrénées—who came in for pasta every week. When the Italian joint closed in 2009, the baker hired him as an apprentice, teaching him to make baguettes, croissants and pains au chocolat, the holy trinity of any boulangerie. It took the Tamil two years to master the French art of the baguette—“using only flour, water, salt and yeast. I learned, learned, learned.” By 2012 he was chief baguette-maker. By 2018 he’d rented the bakery. Three years later, he bought it.\nAfter we chat we go to the bakery, where Mr. Selvarajah hands me a baguette that’s warm to the touch.

John Fetterman is walking along the Great Allegheny Passage across the Monongahela River from his home in Braddock. “I spend as much time as I can out here,” he says of the trail, which runs 150 miles from downtown Pittsburgh to Cumberland, Md.\nOPINION: POTOMAC WATCH\nWhat Were the Most Significant Stories of 2023?\n26:47\n1x\nSUBSCRIBE\nAdd to Queue\nExplore Audio Center\nMr. Fetterman has been in the U.S. Senate just under a year, during which he’s recovered from a campaign-season stroke, checked himself into Walter Reed hospital for depression, and ruffled feathers on both sides of the aisle. In September it was reported that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had relaxed the Senate’s unofficial dress code to accommodate Mr. Fetterman’s preference for wearing hoodies and shorts. (That move backfired, leading the body to adopt a formal requirement of business attire.)\nOf late, however, Mr. Fetterman has drawn the ire of the Democratic left for his unapologetic support of Israel, for his support of a bipartisan solution to the border crisis, and for his cheeky criticisms of the indicted Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.).\nNone of this is a surprise to Pennsylvania political observers. “Now that his health has finally improved, the national press and the country are finding out the real John Fetterman,” says Jeffrey Brauer, a political scientist at Keystone College. Mr. Brauer thinks that Mr. Fetterman’s difficulty communicating after his May 2022 stroke, combined with his casual dress and his combative approach to moderate primary opponent Conor Lamb led outsiders to assume Mr. Fetterman was a card-carrying progressive.\nIn an interview with the Journal, Mr. Fetterman says that assumption was mistaken: “I had been stating clearly that I’m not a progressive, I’m not that kind of a label or anything like that,” he says. “I said that before the primary in ’22, and that’s how I’ve always believed. And I think these have all been very easy calls. I follow the moral clarity, not the polls or any silly labels.”\nMr. Fetterman declared last week that “I would be the last man standing to be absolutely there on the Israeli side on this with no conditions.” Last month he blamed both parties for what he described as a reflexive political resistance to a border security deal. “Since you’ve covered me for years,” he says, “you know me, and you know my wife, and I’ve been very clear and supportive of immigration; I think it’s been part of what has made America, America.” Mr. Fetterman’s wife, Gisele, was 7 when her Brazilian mother brought her to the U.S. illegally. She naturalized in 2009.\n“Two things can be true at the same time,” the senator continues. “We do have a crisis on the border—and we have to look at the numbers that are the size of Pittsburgh showing up on the border. You can’t just say, ‘Oh yeah, OK. It’ll all work itself out.’ ” He sees border security as a matter of common sense: “I think if you really want to address immigration in the way that it deserves, we first must also have a secure border.”\nSince becoming mayor of Braddock in 2006, Mr. Fetterman has often bucked the local and state Democratic Party. In 2016, he ran in a U.S. Senate primary against eventual nominee Katie McGinty. He supported Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton that year and made party officials cringe when he warned that Donald Trump could win Pennsylvania in that year’s general election—as he did. “Anyone that spent time across Pennsylvania would have realized how popular he was and how he connected at a very deep level,” Mr. Fetterman now says.\nIn 2018, Mr. Fetterman ran for lieutenant governor and surprised everyone—including then-Gov. Tom Wolf—by defeating the incumbent, Michael Stack, making him the state’s first lieutenant governor to lose in a primary election. Mr. Fetterman made local activists unhappy along the way, mostly over his support for the natural-gas industry.\nMr. Brauer says Mr. Fetterman has emerged as a center-left senator in a style akin to that of West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema. “What is most interesting is that while the Pennsylvania senior senator, Bob Casey, has gone from being a major centrist to much more a progressive, the junior senator Fetterman is now being perceived as going from a progressive to a much more independent centrist.”\nMr. Fetterman is proud that he acknowledged his depression publicly: “I realize now that addressing mental health is really critical because I’ve had a lot of people reach out to me and thank me for talking about it, and they have their own personal issue,” he says. “I’ve never been afraid of being judged. My only interest is really trying to help people—because I got lucky and I was able to get the kind of help that I needed. I want that kind of help for anybody—I don’t care, Republican, Democrat, anyone.”\nIf there is any stress in having the progressive and socialist wing of his party angry at him, it doesn’t show. Mr. Fetterman looks as healthy as he did when he ran for lieutenant governor in 2017—when he was first diagnosed with an irregular heart rhythm, a diagnosis he later admitted he failed to address, and his doctor said ultimately led to his stroke.\n“Honestly, I feel fantastic,” he says. “That’s the truth.”\nMs. Zito is a reporter for the Washington Examiner and a co-author of “The Great Revolt: Inside the Populist Coalition Reshaping American Politics.”\nAdvertisement\nJournal Editorial Report: Best guesses of what's to come from Kim Strassel, Bill McGurn and Dan Henninger.

PHOTO: FRANCK ROBICHON/SHUTTERSTOCK\nElection-year jitters have the Biden administration and a few swing-state members of Congress from both parties parroting union concerns about Nippon Steel’s takeover of U.S. Steel. The United Steelworkers union favored Cleveland-Cliffs’s offer, which was almost 50% lower than Nippon’s $14.1 billion bid. There is no real cause for concern other than xenophobia and the damage it could do to Cleveland-Cliffs’s position as the sole U.S. producer of electrical steel for transformers and electric vehicles.

National security could be a concern if American mills were shutting down due to unfairly subsidized Japanese exports to the U.S. But Nippon never used gimmicks to avoid the Trump tariffs on steel imports. And its $14.1 billion investment in U.S. Steel is a powerful incentive against any dumping by Japan. There’s nothing in the deal from which the U.S. needs defending. Attacks by Washington pols only create unnecessary geopolitical tensions, and those, not the acquisition itself, could endanger American national security.\nIt would be hypocritical of U.S. politicians to seek market access abroad while arbitrarily blocking it here. Such inconsistency would fan protectionist flames around the world and raise questions about America’s reliability as a trading or national security partner.\nJapan is a major ally, recently agreeing to replenish the U.S. supply of Patriot missiles with ones made by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries under license from Lockheed Martin and RTX, formerly Raytheon Technologies. Japan ranks first in foreign direct investment in the U.S., with more than $700 billion in 2022. U.S. firms are the largest foreign investors in Japan.\nNippon has a history of good labor relations and has pledged to honor U.S. Steel’s union contract, which runs through 2026. The union complained that U.S. Steel blindsided it by giving no advance notice of the deal. Perhaps management can right that misstep by apologizing publicly. The American steel industry is operating at about 75.4% of capacity and idle capacity exceeds U.S. Steel’s total output, so there is no danger of monopolistic behavior by the merged firm. U.S. Steel bonds are in the junk category, but the major rating agencies said upgrades are possible if the Nippon deal goes through. U.S. Steel’s importance in terms of economics and national security can be enhanced only by stronger finances.\nThere was no hubbub when I sold International Steel Group to Indian entrepreneur Lakshmi Mittal in 2005, or when Severstal, a Russian company, bought Ford Motor’s steelmaking unit. So why the clamor today? It’s likely the same sentiment that back in 1989 ignited public controversy and concern over Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi Estate’s deal for Rockefeller Center. Ultimately, the handwringing proved unwarranted. The lights stayed on and the center’s offices, shops and plazas kept functioning. The same will be true of Nippon and U.S. Steel. Neither workers nor customers need have any fears.\nMr. Ross served as commerce secretary, 2017-21.

PHOTO: PATRICK T. FALLON/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nIn a Dec. 28 letter responding to Charles Gasparino’s review of my book, “Witness to a Prosecution” (Bookshelf, Dec. 18), Bruce Baird refers to me as Michael Milken’s “apologist” and accuses me of inventing a “false narrative.” Clearly, he didn’t read the book, and I would never lie or create a false narrative.\nThat Mr. Baird wrote or approved Mr. Milken’s indictment proves nothing. In our country, the accused is innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, a fact that prosecutors too often forget. My book discusses in detail the power of the prosecutor, and how that power can be and was misused.\nMr. Milken pleaded guilty to technical regulatory violations that had never before been the subject of a criminal prosecution.

ROB ADAMS\nBy\nMelanie Evans\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 1, 2024 10:23 am ET\n151\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(8 min)\nFor Minnesotan Tara Young, the perfect beach conditions are when the water is, well, extra stimulating. She prefers the middle of winter, when most mornings she treks off to soak in a nearby frigid lake.\nThe 38-year-old enjoys her chilly pastime so much she volunteers to clear and maintain an opening to the water through inches of ice, so bathers may plunge. \n“I love the sawing and the clearing,” says Young, a mom and retail worker. “It warms you up a bit before you get in.” \nThat hasn’t been needed lately. There was thin or no ice on many Minnesota lakes in December, and the state’s average temperature for the month appears to be the warmest on record. One can hope this all turns around soon.\n“Maybe we’ll get lucky and have a polar vortex,” says Young, referring to a weather pattern that can draw arctic air from the North Pole.\nThat is not a sentiment uttered in most of the U.S., but Minnesotans have an unusually close kinship with winter. For them, it is a season to escape, endure or embrace. The embracers go big. Towns compete for the title of the state’s coldest spot, thrillseekers surf the big waves off Duluth, and bars pop up in the middle of frozen lakes to cater to ice fishermen. \nNow, relatively balmy temperatures and scarce snow have upended life as Minnesotans know it, disrupting routines, canceling wintry events and leaving many anxiously hoping for a return to bone-chilling normal. \n“Pray for cold weather so we can go fishing!” wrote Garrison Sports Bait & Tackle in a post on its Facebook page.\nThe shop on Mille Lacs Lake is about 100 miles north of Minneapolis, not normally a region where the locals need divine intervention to make ice in the winter.\nIn colder years, owners Ashley Schmaltz and her husband, Wayne Schmaltz, use a heavy-duty diesel truck to plow snow from the ice for fishing. As many as 200 ice houses might dot the lake along their property.\nAs of Saturday morning, Schmaltz could see open water. Her family’s portable ice house remains folded in their backyard, and everybody she knows is itching to get out ice fishing. “People are bored.”\nThe local economy also counts on wintertime tourism, so on Facebook Garrison Sports Bait & Tackle is urging anglers who typically take their boats off the water in late fall, to put them back in. “Word is the bite is awesome. We are still offering 20% off bait until the lake freezes!”\nDecember ended with a brief light snow in the Twin Cities, and while things were trending colder, the National Weather Service was forecasting above-normal low temperatures for the start of the year.\nThe unusual season is, in part, because air currents that deliver freezing temperatures to the state have shifted north this year with the El Niño weather system, a natural warming condition in the Pacific Ocean. Climate change has also contributed, says Pete Boulay, a climatologist with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. \nMinnesota’s lack of snow is compounding the problem, since snow reflects solar radiation, Boulay says. Maps updated weekly show snow cover in a pocket of northwestern counties disappearing. The rest of Minnesota is largely bare. \n“Having no snow on the ground is a big factor,” Boulay says. It is also eerie in a state where blizzards can strike as early as Halloween. One epic 1940 storm stranded hunters who froze to death. Heavy snowfall in 2010 accumulated on the inflated covering of the Minnesota Vikings stadium, which couldn’t bear the weight. It collapsed. \nJust last winter, Minnesota snowfall set or neared record amounts in cities including Duluth, Minneapolis and St. Paul. “It’s almost like we had two winters last year, and that’s making up for this one,” says Boulay. \nUnseasonable weather has canceled events that depend on brisk air and snow-packed trails, including kicksledding and cross-country skiing classes at Battle Creek Regional Park in St. Paul.\nAlso put on ice was the Minnesota Ice Festival, which noted in a cancellation announcement that “the weather hasn’t cooperated.”\nOthers remain determined. “We are monitoring the temps in Minneapolis, looking at several forecast models, begging Mother Nature, and praying to the pond hockey gods,” said organizers in a message to teams competing in the U.S. Pond Hockey Championships.\nThe Minneapolis event is scheduled for mid-January on Lake Nokomis, which as of Saturday was a disappointing mix of thin ice and open water.\nIn neighboring St. Paul, snow-making teams at Battle Creek park are closely watching an app for suitable conditions. \n“We’re just waiting for good weather,” says Rob Adams, parks maintenance and operations supervisor for Ramsey County. By good weather, he explains, he means about 10 degrees.\nLately, they have been making snow when a measure of temperature and humidity reaches 27 degrees, the minimum needed. At 3 a.m. Friday, crews got an opening and set to work. Warming temperatures forced them to stop around 11 a.m. \nHe got some requests from snow-nostalgic Minnesotans before the holidays who jokingly asked him to whiten up their front yards. (That was a no-go.) \nMary Collins decided she would learn to love winter when she moved to Minneapolis from more-temperate Seattle in 2017. Collins and her girlfriend even set their wedding date for February. “We love winter,” Collins says. “We decided to lean into it.”\nThey have invited wedding guests to dip into Minneapolis’s Lake Harriet before the ceremony, and have planned cross-country skiing for the following day. \nCollins is staying positive about the dip, since Lake Harriet’s waters will surely be chilly, with or without ice. “We’ll see who shows up,” she says. “Some people are talking a big game.” \n(Those who choose to sit out the bathing will be supplied with coffee and doughnuts, she adds.) \nLet’s face it, warmer temperatures bring benefits. Mark McCabe, parks and recreation director for Ramsey County, says he isn’t missing “the frozen lips and eyelashes as you’re clearing snow off your driveway and it’s blowing back on your face.” \nAdvertisement\nDecember rains helped relieve the state’s drought, a potential boon for farmers this coming year, says Dave Nicolai, a field-crop educator with the University of Minnesota Extension. \nAnd Mike Thomas, general manager for the North Links Golf Course in North Mankato, Minn., sold out tee times days before Christmas and piped holiday music over speakers for players. \nEager golfers, hustling to grab spots that were limited by the season’s early nightfalls, contacted Thomas directly by phone and social media. “I turned away friends,” he says. \nNorth Links closed after a final day of golf on Dec. 23, the latest in 30 years Thomas has managed the course. \nGreg McKush, owner of Montgomery National Golf Club, kept his course open through New Year’s Day, so golfers can boast they played in Minnesota in January. (Another plus: shallow water hazards can freeze overnight, keeping balls in play).\nMcKush says the extended season will help finance planned investments. \n“As much as I like winter and white,” he adds, “green is good right now for me. I mean in the dollar form.” \nWrite to Melanie Evans at melanie.evans@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 2, 2024, print edition as 'Mild Weather Leaves Minnesotans Longing to Have an Ice Day'.\nSHOW CONVERSATION (151)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nMarine Le Pen Found Guilty of Embezzlement, Banned From Next Election\nIf Vaccines Don’t Cause Autism, What Does?\nMike Waltz Is Losing Support Inside the White House\nNo More Mr. Nice Guy.

Garrison. Sports. Bait. Tackle in a post on its. Facebook page. The shop on. Mille. Lacs. Lake is about 100 miles north of. Minneapolis, not normally a region where the locals need divine intervention to make ice in the winter. In colder years, owners. Ashley. Schmaltz and her husband,. Wayne. Schmaltz, use a heavy-duty diesel truck to plow snow from the ice for fishing. As many as 200 ice houses might dot the lake along their property. As of. Saturday morning,.

December ended with a brief light snow in the. Twin. Cities, and while things were trending colder, the. National. Weather. Service was forecasting above-normal low temperatures for the start of the year. The unusual season is, in part, because air currents that deliver freezing temperatures to the state have shifted north this year with the. El. Nio weather system, a natural warming condition in the. Pacific. Ocean. Climate change has also contributed, says. Pete. Boulay, a climatologist with the. Minnesota. Department of. Natural. Resources. Minnesota's lack of snow is compounding the problem, since snow reflects solar radiation,. Boulay says. Maps of northwestern counties disappearing. The rest of. Minnesota is largely bare. \"Having no snow on the ground is a big factor,\". Boulay says. It is also eerie in a state where blizzards can strike as early as. Halloween.

Just last winter,. Minnesota snowfall set or neared record amounts in cities including. Duluth,. Minneapolis and. St. Paul. \"It's almost like we had two winters last year, and that's making up for this one,\" says. Boulay. Unseasonable weather has canceled events that depend on brisk air and snow-packed trails, including kicksledding and cross-country skiing classes at. Battle. Creek. Regional. Park in. St. Paul. Also put on ice was the. Minnesota. Ice. Festival, which noted in a cancellation announcement that \"the weather hasn't cooperated.\". Others remain determined. \"We are monitoring the temps in.

Championships. The. Minneapolis event is scheduled for mid-January on. Lake. Nokomis, which as of. Saturday was a disappointing mix of thin ice and open water. In neighboring. St. Paul, snow-making teams at. Battle. Creek park are closely watching an app for suitable conditions. \"We're just waiting for good weather,\" says. Rob. Adams, parks maintenance and operations supervisor for. Ramsey. County. , he explains, he means about 10 degrees. Lately, they have been making snow when a measure of temperature and humidity reaches 27 degrees, the minimum needed. At 3 a.m. Friday, crews got an opening and set to work. Warming temperatures forced them to stop around 11 a.m. He got some requests from snow-nostalgic. Minnesotans before the holidays who jokingly asked him to whiten up their front yards. That was a no-go. Mary. Collins decided she would learn to love winter when she moved to. Minneapolis from more-temperate. Seattle in . Collins and her girlfriend even set their wedding date for.

PHOTO: SAMUEL CORUM/SIPA USA/POOL/SHUTTERSTOCK\nThe FTC and Meta square off\nIf the Federal Trade Commission gets its way, this could be the year of judgment for a major antitrust case against Meta Platforms. The FTC brought the case in December 2020, during the final weeks of the Trump administration.\nThe FTC, which shares responsibility for enforcing antitrust laws with the Justice Department, alleges Meta, formerly known as Facebook, unlawfully sought to suppress competition by buying up potential rivals such as the messaging platform WhatsApp and image-sharing app Instagram. Meta has said those were procompetitive deals that benefited consumers.\nThe case has moved slowly. In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the complaint originally filed under the Trump administration, saying the FTC hadn’t sufficiently backed up its allegation that Meta has monopoly power. After the agency beefed up and refiled the case, the judge said the agency could begin deposing witnesses.\nBut when the FTC in December asked Boasberg to push the litigation forward, Meta’s lawyers countered that the case is “nowhere near trial.”\n“After delaying nearly a decade to challenge historical acquisitions that the agency reviewed in 2012 and 2014, the FTC has no basis to claim that this case is now urgent,” Meta’s lawyers said.\nWhile the case predates FTC Chair Lina Khan’s tenure, it will help define her legacy. Both before and since she took the post in 2021, Khan has argued in favor of blocking more deals, aggressively attacking monopolistic practices and potentially breaking up some of America’s largest companies, particularly in Big Tech.\nMeta has said Khan is biased, and sought to block her involvement in a different FTC case relating to Meta’s acquisition of the virtual-reality firm Within Unlimited. In that case, a federal judge denied the FTC’s request for an injunction halting the acquisition.  \nThat decision, while a setback for the FTC, included some legal analysis that could help the agency bring similar cases involving nascent markets.\nKhan enters 2024 with a mixed record in court fights. In July, a federal judge ruled against the FTC and allowed Microsoft to go ahead with its $75 billion purchase of videogaming company Activision Blizzard.\nBut in December, a federal appeals court agreed with the FTC that Illumina’s purchase of cancer-test developer Grail was anticompetitive, prompting the San Diego-based company to pursue what its CEO called an “expeditious divestiture” of Grail by the middle of 2024. And on the last business day of 2023, a judge blocked healthcare data provider IQVIA from buying the owner of pharmaceutical ad-technology company DeepIntent, agreeing with the FTC that there was “a reasonable probability that the proposed acquisition will substantially impair competition in the relevant market.”\nThose rulings don’t mean that Khan and Kanter will succeed in persuading more courts to buy in this year to their broader take on antitrust law. “It’s going to be a marathon, not a sprint,” Vanderbilt’s Allensworth said.\nWrite to Jan Wolfe at jan.wolfe@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 4, 2024, print edition as 'Big Tech Braces for Rulings This Year in Antitrust Cases'.\nSHOW CONVERSATION (48)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nMarine Le Pen Found Guilty of Embezzlement, Banned From Next Election\nIf Vaccines Don’t Cause Autism, What Does?\nMike Waltz Is Losing Support Inside the White House\nNo More Mr. Nice Guy.

         "The Sports-Betting Traders Deciding How Much You Win or Lose\nOn an NFL Sunday, oddsmakers juggle athletic drama on the field and the financial stakes behind it\nTraders work at the FanDuel office during Sunday-football events in Jersey City, N.J.\nBy\nKatherine Sayre\nFollow\n| Photography by Gabby Jones for The Wall Street Journal\nJan. 1, 2024 7:01 am ET\n141\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(7 min)\nJERSEY CITY, N.J.—Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill recently marked a 78-yard touchdown with an unusual celebration. He and teammates imitated riding a roller coaster, sitting on the field with their arms waving overhead.\nMore than 200 miles away, sports-betting company FanDuel’s sports-trading desk was riding its own waves that Sunday afternoon. The traders on duty—self-professed sports buffs with a knack for math—were trying to predict how National Football League athletes and teams would perform that day. \nSports-trading desks are similar to financial-trading desks on Wall Street, which enable investors to buy and sell stocks and bonds. However, the sports desks create odds to influence and entice bets in a live market where hundreds of millions of dollars are exchanged on American athletic events.\nThe Miami Dolphins celebrate a touchdown. PHOTO: GEOFF BURKE/USA TODAY SPORTS/REUTERS\nHill’s seconds-long run into the endzone meant a $68,000 hit to the sportsbook on customer bets on whether he would score the first touchdown of the game. Immediately, bettors’ money started rolling in on Hill to score more touchdowns and gain more yards.\nThe Dolphins ended up trouncing the Washington Commanders 45-15. FanDuel lost $1 million on the game.\n“You have good days, bad days,” said Will Twinn, a lead FanDuel sports trader that day. “It’s really about getting the prices right and let the cards fall where they may.”\nSports betting has become big business for gambling companies, sports leagues and media outlets over the past five years. By the time your finger taps the glass of a smartphone screen to place a bet, a sportsbook trading desk powered by algorithms and raw data on past and current games has made its best guess of what is likely to play out on the field.\nFanDuel’s algorithm simulates each play of a football game 10,000 times to try to predict the outcome, who might score a touchdown or how many yards a wide receiver might get.\nWhile financial markets typically operate within set trading windows, sportsbooks add new markets—additional betting offerings—around the clock. If a trader needs to step away for a quick break, another steps in.\nOn the recent Sunday, FanDuel took in more than $200 million bets on NFL games. That figure is the total amount customers placed in bets that day, before winnings were paid out.\nAs one FanDuel trader rushed to shift the Dolphins’ odds after Hill’s touchdown, another monitored the New England Patriots’ matchup with the Los Angeles Chargers. Patriots running back Rhamondre Stevenson had to be helped off the field after an ankle injury.\nThe trader immediately started adjusting the odds, making it more likely that Stevenson’s backup would score. “That’s information we didn’t know 15 minutes ago,” Twinn said.\nSports-betting companies must strike a balance between protecting the business’s bottom line and setting prices—the possible winnings—appealing enough that customers will want to make a bet. The more accurately a company can predict what will happen, the more money they stand to make. It is a science and an art.\nJust as financial trading desks pipe in securities prices from stock exchanges, sports desks rely on data feeds from the NFL.\nFanDuel said it takes about 1.5 seconds to receive the data point—what happened on the field—and about 1 second for its model to process the data and push out new odds. That information travels faster than the game broadcasts and streams viewers watch at home.\nSports-trading desks create odds to influence and entice bets in a live market where hundreds of millions of dollars are exchanged on American athletic events.\nThe basic tenet of gambling—that the house always wins—lives on. While any given day might be a win or a loss for a sportsbook, overall, FanDuel said it makes about 11.5% in revenue from the total bets it accepts, after paying out winning bets.\nFanDuel is owned by Flutter Entertainment, a Dublin-based gambling operator with popular brands in Europe and Australia. FanDuel was a daily fantasy-sports company when the Supreme Court issued a ruling in 2018 that ushered in a new era of gambling in the U.S. States beyond Nevada could legalize sports betting, and many state governments rushed in.\nFor Flutter and FanDuel, the challenge was establishing a trading desk from a talent pool in the U.S. with little experience in sports betting. Twinn, who started as a trader at Flutter’s Sportsbet in Australia, moved to the U.S. in 2019. He left the company shortly after the Dolphins-Commanders game.\nAdvertisement\nOn the recent Sunday, when several NFL games were scheduled to start at 1 p.m. ET, traders in Flutter’s offices in Dublin took the first shift. They monitored pregame news from around 2 a.m. ET and began adjusting the day’s odds. The Jersey City traders then took over, and by Sunday Night Football, the sportsbook was in the hands of traders in Melbourne, Australia.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat is your outlook on FanDuel in 2024? Join the conversation below.\nSpencer Diaz, in his second NFL season as a FanDuel trader, sat in front of a half-dozen screens at his desk. One featured a high-speed video stream from the NFL of his assigned game, the Dolphins against the Commanders. Another showed a grid of odds from other sportsbooks for a view of the market trends. A third displayed FanDuel’s automated system, where traders can compare the FanDuel’s modeling with what is playing out on the field.\nDiaz, a lifelong sports fan, picked working at FanDuel over going to law school. He said taking over responsibility for a game was, at first, “a bit nerve-wracking seeing all the money coming in.”\nThe Dolphins were favored to win at kickoff by 8.5 points, which shifted to 17 points as the game progressed. After Hill scored another touchdown, FanDuel decided the odds favored Miami to have a more decisive win, by a margin of about 22 points.\nEd Miller, who co-founded a company that automates sportsbook pricing for gambling companies, said the modern sportsbook is a far cry from Las Vegas-style sports betting in which human bookmakers made the calculations and you might find a white board with a game’s odds written on it.\nFanDuel, which is going head-to-head with DraftKings for the No. 1 position in the sports-betting market, asserted its dominance with help of a now-ubiquitous product: the single-game parlay. A bettor can string together several bets on one game, including how specific players will perform.\nThe chances of winning—that each leg of the parlay will, in fact, happen in the game—lean heavily in favor of the house. The appeal of a big cashout, though, has maintained its popularity.\nFor example, when the Baltimore Ravens played the Jacksonville Jaguars on Dec. 17, FanDuel offered a seven-leg parlay on how five star players would perform in passing yards, receiving yards, rushing yards and touchdowns. A $10 wager would win $457. (The athletes’ performances didn’t pan out that way, and no customers won.)\nA more straightforward bet that total points scored in the game would be more than 41.5 generated about $9 in winnings on a $10 bet.\nSpencer Diaz, a trader for FanDuel and a lifelong sports fan, picked working at FanDuel over going to law school.\nWrite to Katherine Sayre at katherine.sayre@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 2, 2024, print edition as 'Sports-Betting Traders Juggle Athletic Drama, Money Behind It'.\nSHOW CONVERSATION (141)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nMarine Le Pen Found Guilty of Embezzlement, Banned From Next Election\nIf Vaccines Don’t Cause Autism, What Does?\nMike Waltz Is Losing Support Inside the White House\nNo More Mr. Nice Guy.

Sports betting has become big business for gambling companies, sports leagues and media outlets over the past five years. your finger taps the glass of a smartphone screen to place a bet, a sportsbook trading desk powered raw data on past and current games has made its best guess of what is likely to play out on the field. FanDuel's algorithm simulates each play of a football game 10,000 times to try to predict the outcome, who might score a touchdown or how many yards a wide receiver might get. While financial markets typically operate within set trading windows, sportsbooks add new marketsadditional betting offeringsaround the clock. If a trader needs to step away for a quick break, another steps in. On the recent. Sunday,. FanDuel took in more than 200 million bets on. NFL games. That figure is the total amount customers placed in bets that day, before winnings were paid out. As one. FanDuel trader rushed to shift the. Dolphins' odds after. Hill's touchdown, another monitored the. New. England. Patriots' matchup with the. Los. Angeles. Chargers. Patriots running back. Rhamondre. Stevenson had to be helped off the field after an ankle injury. The trader immediately started adjusting the odds, making it more likely that. Stevenson's backup would score. \"That's information we didn't know 15 minutes ago,\". Twinn said. Sports-betting companies must strike a balance between protecting the business's bottom line and setting pricesthe possible winningsappealing enough that customers will want to make a bet. The more accurately a company can predict what will happen, the more money they stand to make. It is a science and an art. Just as financial trading desks pipe in securities prices from stock exchanges, sports desks rely on data feeds from the. NFL. FanDuel said it takes about 1.5 seconds to receive the data pointwhat happened on the fieldand about 1 second for its model to process the data and push out new odds. That information travels faster than the game broadcasts and streams viewers watch at home. Sports-trading desks create odds to influence and entice bets in a live market where hundreds of millions of dollars are exchanged on. American athletic events. The basic tenet of gamblingthat the house always winslives on. While any given day might be a win or a loss for a sportsbook, overall,. FanDuel said it makes about 11.5 in revenue from the total bets it accepts, after paying out winning bets. FanDuel is owned , a. Dublin-based gambling operator with popular brands in. Europe and. Australia. FanDuel was a daily fantasy-sports company when the. Supreme. Court issued a ruling in that ushered in a new era of gambling in the. U.S. States beyond. Nevada could legalize sports betting, and many state governments rushed in. For. Flutter and. FanDuel, the challenge was establishing a trading desk from a talent pool in the. U.S. with little experience in sports betting. Twinn, who started as a trader at. Flutter's. Sportsbet in. Australia, moved to the. U.S. in . He left the company shortly after the. Dolphins-Commanders game. On the recent. Sunday, when several. NFL games were scheduled to start at 1 p.m. ET, traders in. Flutter's offices in. Dublin took the first shift. They monitored pregame news from around 2 a.m. ET and began adjusting the day's odds. The. Jersey. City traders then took over, and. Football, the sportsbook was in the hands of traders in. Melbourne,. Australia. What is your outlook on. FanDuel in ? Join the conversation below. Spencer. Diaz, in his second. NFL season as a. FanDuel trader, sat in front of a half-dozen screens at his desk. One featured a high-speed video stream from the. NFL of his assigned game, the. Dolphins against the. Commanders. Another showed a grid of odds from other sportsbooks for a view of the market trends. A third displayed. FanDuel's automated system, where traders can compare the. FanDuel's modeling with what is playing out on the field. Diaz, a lifelong sports fan, picked working at. FanDuel over going to law school. He said taking over responsibility for a game was, at first, \"a bit nerve-wracking seeing all the money coming in.\". The. Dolphins were favored to win at kickoff by 8.5 points, which shifted to 17 points as the game progressed. After. Hill scored another touchdown,. FanDuel decided the odds favored. Miami to have a more decisive win, by a margin of about 22 points. Ed. Miller, who co-founded a company that automates sportsbook pricing for gambling companies, said the modern sportsbook is a far cry from. Las. Vegas-style sports betting in which human bookmakers made the calculations and you might find a white board with a game's odds written on it. FanDuel, which is going head-to-head with. DraftKings for the. No. 1 position in the sports-betting market, asserted its dominance with help of a now-ubiquitous product the single-game parlay. A bettor can string together several bets on one game, including how specific players will perform. The chances of winningthat each leg of the parlay will, in fact, happen in the gamelean heavily in favor of the house. The appeal of a big cashout, though, has maintained its popularity. For example, when the. Baltimore. Ravens played the. Jacksonville. Jaguars on. Dec. 17,. FanDuel offered a seven-leg parlay on how five star players would perform in passing yards, receiving yards, rushing yards and touchdowns. A 10 wager would win 457. The athletes' performances didn't pan out that way, and no customers won. A more straightforward bet that total points scored in the game would be more than 41.5 generated about 9 in winnings on a 10 bet. No. More. Mr. Nice. Guy. In. Fighting. Trump,. Canada.

PHOTO: ERIC THAYER/BLOOMBERG NEWS\nEmployers slowed hiring and handed out smaller raises in recent months, signs of fading momentum in the job market that have some forecasters expecting unemployment to rise in 2024.\nAnd that might be OK. The key for American workers and Federal Reserve policymakers is to have the labor market cool without collapsing. That would support household incomes while helping inflation drift lower, putting the economy on a glide path to a soft landing—as long as the slowdown isn’t too severe.\n“You can see these small cracks forming” in the labor market, said Michael Pugliese, a senior economist at Wells Fargo. “That should give you reason for pause going into 2024.” \nHere is where the labor market is heading in the new year.\nCooling trend\nThe U.S. labor market was a pillar of economic strength in 2023, with solid hiring and rising wages helping households navigate high inflation and an otherwise bleak view of the economy. It was also too hot for the Fed. Officials at the central bank worried that high demand for goods and services alongside a constrained supply of workers would push wages up too fast, fueling inflation.\nSeveral factors combined to cool it off—to the point that economists expect hiring to slow considerably in 2024.\nThe Fed’s campaign of interest-rate hikes made it more expensive to borrow money, slowing some economic activity. Many industries that had struggled to find workers surpassed prepandemic employment levels, making hiring less urgent. People came off the sidelines and immigration picked up, adding to the pool of available workers.\nBy the end of 2023, workers had stopped job hopping as much, while employers hired less but kept layoffs low. The result was a less-frenzied labor market.\nConcentrated hiring\nJob growth also became more concentrated in a handful of industries: healthcare and social assistance (which includes private-sector child-care workers, home-care aides and social workers), leisure and hospitality, as well as state and local government. Outside those sectors, hiring slowed sharply and in some areas contracted.\nThe less dynamic labor market helped put a brake on rapid wage growth—a key consideration for the Fed. Average hourly earnings across the private sector rose at an almost 6% annual pace early in 2022 but cooled to 4% near the end of 2023. In sectors with the greatest competition for workers, such as restaurants, wage gains also eased substantially.\nWage pressures could still prove too hot for the Fed. Current pay gains still aren’t consistent with the central bank’s 2% inflation target, said Chris Varvares, co-head of U.S. economics at S&P Global Market Intelligence. That means job growth will have to slow further to bring the labor market into better balance.\n“We think employment growth remains positive but too slow to absorb all entrants into the labor force,” Varvares said. That will push the unemployment rate to 4.1%, according to S&P forecasts, up from November’s 3.7% and the highest level since the end of 2021.\nTemporary weakness\nAnother warning sign for the labor market: Temporary hiring has been on a downward slope for more than a year. Temps are considered a bellwether for the labor market. They are often the first hired as businesses start staffing up and the first dismissed when the economy sours.\nAdvertisement\n“There’s a clear trend toward cooling,” said Andy Challenger, senior vice president at outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “We expect elevated layoffs into the first quarter and after that it could level off or get worse.”\nStill, there are reasons for optimism. The labor market has cooled, but as of November, it was still producing jobs at a faster pace than it was just before the pandemic. Consumer spending has proven resilient, propelling demand for an array of goods and services—and the people who produce them. And companies, broadly, have been reluctant to lay off workers after they so recently struggled to find and keep them.\n“Unemployment is unlikely to increase dramatically as companies shy away from firing workers,” Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a research note. “Labor shortages and the high turnover costs over the past several years mean firms are hesitant to let their workers go even as economic growth slows.”\nWrite to Jeffrey Sparshott at Jeffrey.Sparshott@wsj.com and Gabriel T.

That is higher than the overall average of 64.9%. The index has returned an average of 6.15% in election years.\nThe major risk remains disappointment over interest rates.

Interest-rate derivatives traders are betting on more—projecting interest rates about 1.5 percentage points below current levels, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.

Here is how Biden has fared on his major 2020 campaign proposals:\nHow many promises has Biden kept?\nKept\nStalled\nNot kept\nEach dot represents a promise\nTOPIC PROMISES\nEconomy\nImmigration\nForeign policy\nClimate\nCriminal justice and guns\n^ Select a topic to scroll down to that section\nThe promises\nInfrastructure Prescription drugs ‘Remain in Mexico’ Travel ban Afghanistan Global alliances Paris agreement Keystone XL pipeline Climate investments Nonviolent drug offenders Taxes Student loans Paid leave Child and elder care Minimum wage Pathway to citizenship Iran deal Assault-weapons ban Border wall Asylum limits Detention Offshore drilling Death penalty\n^ Select a promise to scroll down to it\nEconomy\nBiden campaigned on turning around an economy that had suffered during the pandemic, pledging government spending, repealing Trump-era tax cuts for the wealthy and lowering costs.\nPROMISE KEPT\nInfrastructure\nBiden signed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill into law in November 2021. Investing in infrastructure was a central part of Biden’s domestic policy agenda during the campaign.\nPROMISE KEPT\nPrescription drugs\nAs a candidate, Biden proposed repealing the law that bars Medicare from negotiating lower prices with drug corporations. Instead of repealing the law, Biden signed into law a measure that would allow the federal government to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs for some Medicare recipients.\nPROMISE STALLED\nTaxes\nBiden ran on reversing the parts of the 2017 tax law that benefited corporations and high-income households while expanding the child tax credit. He got partway there. The child-credit expansion was in place for 2021 before lapsing. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act created a new minimum tax on large corporations. But many of Biden’s other tax increases on high-income Americans ran into opposition in the Senate.\nPROMISE STALLED\nStudent loans\nBiden proposed canceling $10,000 of every federal borrower’s loans during the campaign. After facing pressure from progressives, Biden said in August 2022 he would cancel up to $20,000 for borrowers below a certain income threshold, but the Supreme Court overturned his plan. The administration has used other tools to cancel student debt. More than three million borrowers have had $132 billion of their federal student loans flagged for cancellation.\nPROMISE STALLED\nPaid leave\nBiden’s campaign proposal called for 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. He included it as part of his economic agenda in 2021, but it was ultimately taken out during congressional negotiations.\nPROMISE STALLED\nChild and elder care\nAs a candidate, Biden released a plan to spend $775 billion over 10 years on supporting child care and elder care and setting up universal prekindergarten. He released a proposal that included those aspects in 2021, but they were ultimately left out of the legislative priorities that were signed into law.\nPROMISE STALLED\nMinimum wage\nBiden called for increasing the federal minimum wage to $15, but the measure was taken out of his legislative proposals.\n^BACK TO TOP\nImmigration\nBiden bashed Trump’s hard-line immigration policies during the campaign and promised a different approach. So far in his first term, he has reversed some Trump policies, but the record surge in migrants crossing the southern border prompted him to adopt some of Trump’s measures.\nPROMISE KEPT\n‘Remain in Mexico’\nAfter a two-year court battle, the Biden administration ended in 2022 the program known as Remain in Mexico, which requires migrants seeking asylum to live in northern Mexican border cities during their U.S. court proceedings. The administration took longer to end the policy than immigration advocates had expected.\nPROMISE KEPT\nTravel ban\nBiden signed an executive order reversing a Trump-era travel ban from several largely Muslim and African countries on his first day in office.\nPROMISE STALLED\nPathway to citizenship\nBiden said he would work with Congress to pass an immigration bill that would include a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants in the country who lack a permanent legal status. Although the president released a proposal, Congress has largely ignored it.\nPROMISE NOT KEPT\nBorder wall\nDuring the campaign, Biden pledged that “not another foot” of border wall would be built in his administration. He issued an executive order halting all wall construction on his first day in office. But in October, the Department of Homeland Security outlined its intent to build up to 20 new miles of border barriers—of the kind used by the Trump administration—in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.\nPROMISE NOT KEPT\nAsylum limits\nBiden campaigned against Trump’s more restrictive asylum policies. But in January, he proposed a version of his predecessor’s asylum rule that would make migrants who move through another country on the way and don’t first apply for asylum in that country ineligible for asylum in the U.S.\nPROMISE NOT KEPT\nDetention\nBiden pledged to stop contracting with for-profit detention centers. Although he signed an executive order to end the use of private prisons, he did not issue a similar one for those held in the immigration detention system.\n^BACK TO TOP\nForeign policy\nBiden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, campaigned on ending wars and restoring U.S. alliances. Although he withdrew troops from Afghanistan, the U.S. is now helping fund two new conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.\nPROMISE KEPT\nAfghanistan\nBiden campaigned on ending the “forever wars,” and bringing most U.S. troops home from Afghanistan and the Middle East. The last American troops in Afghanistan left at the end of August 2021, marking the formal end of the longest war in U.S. history. Although the president kept his promise, the withdrawal was broadly seen as chaotic and included the death of 13 service members in an attack in Kabul.\nPROMISE KEPT\nGlobal alliances\nBiden said he would strengthen U.S. alliances, particularly with NATO. He has since rallied NATO countries against Russia’s war in Ukraine and helped expand the alliance to include Finland and Sweden.\nPROMISE STALLED\nIran deal\nBiden said as a candidate that he would return to the 2015 Iran nuclear accord, if Tehran also agreed to abide by it. His administration has tried to renegotiate the deal, but has been so far unsuccessful.\n^BACK TO TOP\nClimate\nBiden proposed the most aggressive climate agenda of any major presidential nominee and has followed through on elements of it, including the passage of a sweeping climate spending bill.\nPROMISE KEPT\nParis agreement\nBiden pledged to rejoin the 2015 Paris climate accord to cut global greenhouse-gas emissions and followed through.\nPROMISE KEPT\nKeystone XL pipeline\nOn his first day in office, Biden followed through on a campaign pledge and revoked a permit for Keystone XL, an expansion of an existing pipeline that carries Canadian crude into the U.S.\nPROMISE KEPT\nClimate investments\nBiden’s campaign proposal called for $2 trillion in spending. In August of 2022, he signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law to boost spending on renewable energy and encourage the adoption of electric vehicles.\nPROMISE NOT KEPT\nOffshore drilling\nBiden promised to stop all new offshore drilling under his administration. But in September, the administration said it planned to schedule three oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico over the next five years.\n^BACK TO TOP\nCriminal justice and guns\nBiden promised to confront the legacies of the “tough-on-crime” laws that he once supported in the Senate that disproportionately affected minorities and filled prisons with nonviolent offenders. He also ran as a candidate with a record of standing up to the National Rifle Association, given his role in the passage of a 10-year assault-weapons ban that expired in 2004.\nPROMISE KEPT\nNonviolent drug offenders\nIn 2022, Biden granted his first pardons and commutations to 78 people convicted mostly of nonviolent drug offenses. Later that year, he pardoned all prior federal offenses of simple possession of marijuana. He closed 2023 with another round of clemencies for marijuana-related offenses.\nPROMISE STALLED\nAssault-weapons ban\nBiden has continued his call for an assault-weapons ban from the campaign trail to the White House, but he has been unsuccessful in getting an agreement through Congress. He did sign into law the widest firearms legislation in decades. It includes requiring that background checks cover the juvenile and mental-health records of gun purchasers under 21 years of age.\nPROMISE NOT KEPT\nDeath penalty\nBiden said during the campaign he would push for legislation to end the death penalty on the federal level and incentivize states to do the same. As president, he hasn't followed through on the promise. The Justice Department imposed a moratorium on federal executions, but it has sought the death penalty in some cases.\nPhotos: ASSOCIATED PRESS (1); AGENCE-FRANCE PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES (2)\nRichard Rubin and Andrew Mollica contributed to this article.\nWrite to Tarini Parti at tarini.parti@wsj.com and Kara Dapena at kara.dapena@wsj.com\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat do you think will be the most prominent lasting legacy of the Biden presidency?

         "China’s Xi Is Resurrecting Mao’s ‘Continuous Revolution’ With a Twist\nThe Chinese leader has made his corruption purge—with millions punished—a pillar of his rule. It risks paralyzing his party.\nChinese leader Xi Jinping recently met with senior officers of the armed forces stationed in Nanning, southern China. LI GANG/XINHUA/ZUMA PRESS\nBy Chun Han WongFollow\nUpdated Jan. 1, 2024 12:08 am ET\nSAVE\nSHARE\nTEXT\n386 RESPONSES\nListen to article\nLength\n(10 minutes)\nQueue\nExplore Audio Center\nChinese rulers have long used campaigns against corruption to sideline rivals and consolidate power. Xi Jinping is increasingly tying his authority to a new variation: a purge that never ends.\nWith echoes of Mao Zedong’s “continuous revolution,” Xi has sent fear rippling through the ranks of the Communist Party for more than a decade with the largest campaign against corruption in modern Chinese history. It is now threatening to petrify the party as it tries to steer the world’s second-largest economy through its greatest period of uncertainty in a generation.\nSince he came to power in 2012, party enforcers have punished roughly five million people for offenses as serious as abuse of power and as innocuous as creating excessive red tape.\nIn 2023 alone, the unrelenting campaign swept through the worlds of finance, food, healthcare, semiconductors and sports—taking down scores of senior officials, bankers, hospital directors and even soccer administrators. China’s foreign and defense ministers went missing in the summer before being abruptly removed from their posts, leading to suspicions that they, too, have been purged. Beijing’s recent ouster of a dozen senior military and defense-industry officials from the national legislature and a government advisory body have fueled speculation about a broader shake-up of the country’s military establishment.\nLi Shangfu hasn’t made a public appearance since late August and U.S. officials say the Chinese Defense Minister is being ousted from his post. Li is the latest of several senior Chinese officials to disappear without explanation. Photo: How Hwee Young/Shutterstock\nThere is no end in sight. The Chinese leader recently outlined his plans for how the campaign would proceed in the next few years and has even targeted the very agency tasked with carrying it out.\nCritics of Xi say the campaign’s extension into a second decade is a result of his refusal to accept structural changes and greater transparency that are necessary for cleaner governance. \nAn anticorruption campaign in China is extending into a second decade as its economy, the world’s second largest, faces several challenges. PHOTO: NG HAN GUAN/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe Chinese leader has instead cast the blame on the moral failings of individuals, while doubling down on his centralized and opaque style of governance, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Xi’s remarks, party directives and official data. Only a continual cleansing can ensure the party remains potent and pure, he has argued.\n“Battling corruption is the most thorough form of self-revolution,” Xi said days before starting his third term as party chief in October 2022. “As long as the soil and conditions conducive for corruption continue to exist, the fight against corruption can’t cease for a moment.”\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWSJ China\nExclusive insights on the contest between the U.S. and China, brought to you by the WSJ’s top China correspondent.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nSuch an assertion clears the way for Xi to use disciplinary purges indefinitely as a way to enforce fealty, through fear, to himself and his vision.\n“In China, campaigns are supposed to be an intense but short burst of enforcement,” said Yuen Yuen Ang, a political-science professor at Johns Hopkins University. “Xi has invented a paradoxical policy tool: a perpetual campaign.”\nWhile the forever purge buttresses Xi’s authority, it also has instilled a constant apprehension and reluctance to act decisively among party members as challenges mount. The economy is struggling to shake its Covid hangover. Youth unemployment has skyrocketed, and the property market and consumer sentiment have tanked. Meanwhile, debt is piling up and foreign investors are increasingly turning their backs on the Chinese market.\nAdvertisement\nIn the early years of the campaign, many officials saw it as a longer and more ambitious version of previous efforts. Roughly 180,000 people were disciplined for infractions in 2013, a number that climbed to some 621,000 in 2018, the year Xi proclaimed a “crushing victory” over corruption.\nOfficial data show at least half a million people being disciplined every year since 2017—around four times as many as were typically punished annually when Xi’s predecessor held power from 2002 to 2012. \nBy some measures, corruption has indeed fallen under Xi. Berlin-based advocacy group Transparency International ranked China 65th in its 2022 index on perceptions of public-sector corruption in 180 countries and territories, an improvement from 80th out of 176 jurisdictions in 2012, the year Xi took power. \nAdvertisement\nA survey published in 2020 by Harvard University’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation found that the proportion of Chinese citizens who saw officials as being generally “clean” rose to more than 65% in 2016 from roughly 35% in 2011. \nXi Jinping has outlined plans for how his anticorruption campaign would proceed in the next few years. PHOTO: NOEL CELIS/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nThere are other indications, however, that Xi hasn’t curbed corruption so much as pushed it deeper into the shadows. The new five-year plan for fighting graft released in September pledges to curb new and hidden forms of corruption where officials use murky corporate structures and “revolving doors” between the public and private sectors to seek illicit gains.\nA recent case involving Zhang Jing, a former local official in southwestern China, shows corruption has remained insidious and persistent. Zhang’s offenses date to the early 2000s, when as a township party chief, he started accepting “red envelopes” of cash from entrepreneurs and friends in return for providing inside information about government projects, according to an official account.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nCan Xi Jinping’s strategy guide China through economic crisis? Join the conversation below.\nWhen one of those entrepreneurs was detained by authorities in 2013, Zhang grew frightened, to the point of asking a feng shui master to pray for his safety, according to the account. He tried to cover his tracks, such as by returning a bribe to one entrepreneur through a bank transfer—so that he could cite bank records to plead innocence—before taking the bribe again in cash later.\nAuthorities didn’t catch up with Zhang until 2022, when the party detained and eventually expelled him. In March 2023, he was sentenced to four years in jail after being found to have taken more than 1.24 million yuan worth of bribes, equivalent to around $175,000 at current rates.\n“I didn’t pull back from the precipice and confess to the organization in time,” he said in his confession. “Instead I racked my brains to try to cover up my crimes.”\nAdvertisement\nInvestigations involving more visible forms of corruption have fallen in recent years, according to official data. People punished for dining on public money dropped to around 9,300 in 2022 from 13,600 in 2018, and those disciplined for holding lavish events such as weddings and banquets slipped below 3,000 from 7,000 over the same period.\nMeanwhile, the number of people disciplined for improper giving and receiving of gifts—a more hidden form of graft—have steadily climbed, rising to 23,000 in 2022 from about 6,800 in 2015.\nThe party’s top internal watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, has warned about a growing trend of “options corruption”—named after a type of financial contract—whereby crooked cadres provide favors in return for deferred bribes to be paid out only after they retire, as a way to mask their misconduct.\nDespite his efforts to fight graft, which include cutting government approvals and red tape that officials can abuse to extract bribes, Xi hasn’t enacted deeper structural changes—such as asset disclosures—that experts in clean government say are needed to attack corruption at its root. \nAdvertisement\nXi seems to accept some levels of graft as an unavoidable consequence of sustaining one-party rule, some analysts say, whereby corruption is to be suppressed—rather than eradicated—through eternal vigilance.\nCommunist Party enforcers have punished millions for offenses as serious as abuse of power and as innocuous as creating excessive red tape since Xi came to power in 2012. PHOTO: WANG YE/XINHUA/ZUMA PRESS\nFor Xi, “it is all about attitude and mental disposition, not about institutional checks and balances,” according to Daniel Leese, a professor of Chinese history at the University of Freiburg.\nLeese and other historians say Xi’s perpetual purges are inspired in part by Mao’s ideas on waging “continuous revolution,” which were meant to avert ideological atrophy in the party and broader society. \nBut whereas Mao roused ordinary Chinese into purging class enemies and assaulting what he saw as a decaying party from the outside, Xi has shaken up the party from within, using fear to enforce virtuous behavior. Even the party’s discipline inspectors themselves have become targets, under a rectification campaign launched in February that aims to “turn the blade inward and cut out decaying flesh.”\nAdvertisement\nThe point is to maintain constant pressure, according to Leese. “There is simply no way of reaching a final stop with this model,” he said.\nWhile it has helped Xi accumulate a level of power unseen since Mao, party insiders say his “rule-by-fear” approach has stifled policy debate and fueled indecision among lower-level officials at a time when China requires more decisive leadership to deal with long-term challenges. \nA ‘rule-by-fear’ approach has helped Xi Jinping accumulate a level of power unseen since Mao Zedong. PHOTO: JADE GAO/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nThe fear is leading bureaucrats to act timidly, with potentially significant impact on the economy, researchers say. “Officials are more inclined to provide favors to [state-owned enterprises], thereby reducing their career risks because such allocations do not imply corruption,” Zeren Li and Songrui Liu, a pair of Chinese researchers, wrote in a recent study. Such favoritism undermines economic efficiency and diverts resources from more dynamic private enterprises, they argued. \nParty authorities also have issued fresh warnings against “formalism,” or box-ticking behavior that cadres engage in to feign compliance with Beijing—bogging down the bureaucracy in unproductive work.\nThe persistent slowdown in China’s economy magnifies both the stakes and challenges for the party. Xi’s dominance “has made it difficult for lower officials to make decisions because they are concerned about running into trouble,” particularly given conflicting policy demands, said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research in Hong Kong. “They are at the difficult end of choices between paying for social services, economic development, and lowering debt levels—an impossible balancing act.”\nXi has signaled no retreat.\n“The struggle against corruption will never end,” the Communist Party’s top antigraft body said in a recent commentary. “It will only be ongoing, but never completed.”\nWrite to Chun Han Wong at chunhan.wong@wsj.com\nU.S.-China Tensions\nTracking the complicated relationship of the world's two largest economies\nPODCAST SERIES: CHINA BUILDS INFLUENCE WITH INFRASTRUCTURE\nThe Warship That Shows Why the U.S. Navy Is Falling Behind China\nChina’s Xi Is Angered by Panama Port Deal Trump Touted as a Win\nInside the Chinese Region That Has Become a No-Go for Western Companies\nChinese Ships Are Carrying America’s Cargo.

Zhang's offenses date to the early s, when as a township party chief, he started accepting \"red envelopes\" of cash from entrepreneurs and friends in return for providing inside information about government projects, according to an official account. Can. Xi. Jinping's strategy guide. China through economic crisis? Join the conversation below. When one of those entrepreneurs was detained ,. Zhang grew frightened, to the point of asking a feng shui master to pray for his safety, according to the account. He tried to cover his tracks, such as by returning a bribe to one entrepreneur through a bank transferso that he could cite bank records to plead innocencebefore taking the bribe again in cash later. Authorities didn't catch up with. Zhang until , when the party detained and eventually expelled him. In. March , he was sentenced to four years in jail after being found to have taken more than 1.24 million yuan worth of bribes, equivalent to around 175,000 at current rates. \"I didn't pull back from the precipice and confess to the organization in time,\" he said in his confession. \"Instead. I racked my brains to try to cover up my crimes.\". Investigations involving more visible forms of corruption have fallen in recent years, according to official data. People punished for dining on public money dropped to around 9,300 in from 13,600 in , and those disciplined for holding lavish events such as weddings and banquets slipped below 3,000 from 7,000 over the same period. Meanwhile, the number of people disciplined for improper giving and receiving of giftsa more hidden form of grafthave steadily climbed, rising to 23,000 in from about 6,800 in . The party's top internal watchdog, the. Central. Commission for. Discipline. Inspection, has warned about a growing trend of \"options corruption\"named after a type of financial contractwhere provide favors in return for deferred bribes to be paid out only after they retire, as a way to mask their misconduct. Despite his efforts to fight graft, which include cutting government approvals and red tape that officials can abuse to extract bribes,. Xi hasn't enacted deeper structural changessuch as asset disclosuresthat experts in clean government say are needed to attack corruption at its root. Xi seems to accept some levels of graft as an unavoidable consequence of sustaining one-party rule, some analysts say, where to be suppressedrather than eradicatedthrough eternal vigilance. Communist. Party enforcers have punished millions for offenses as serious as abuse of power and as innocuous as creating excessive red tape since. Xi came to power in . For. Xi, \"it is all about attitude and mental disposition, not about institutional checks and balances,\" according to. Daniel. Leese, a professor of. Chinese history at the. University of. Freiburg. Leese and other historians say. Xi's perpetual purges are inspired in part by. Mao's ideas on waging \"continuous revolution,\" which were meant to avert ideological atrophy in the party and broader society. But whereas. Mao roused ordinary. Chinese into purging class enemies and assaulting what he saw as a decaying party from the outside,. Xi has shaken up the party from within, using fear to enforce virtuous behavior. Even the party's discipline inspectors themselves have become targets, under a rectification campaign launched in. February that aims to \"turn the blade inward and cut out decaying flesh.\". The point is to maintain constant pressure, according to. Leese. \"There is simply no way of reaching a final stop with this model,\" he said. While it has helped. Xi accumulate a level of power unseen since. Mao, party insiders say his \"rule-by-fear\" approach has stifled policy debate and fueled indecision among lower-level officials at a time when. China requires more decisive leadership to deal with long-term challenges. A 'rule-by-fear' approach has helped. Xi. Jinping accumulate a level of power unseen since. Mao. Zedong. The fear is leading bureaucrats to act timidly, with potentially significant impact on the economy, researchers say. \"Officials are more inclined to provide favors to state-owned enterprises, there career risks because such allocations do not imply corruption,\". Zeren. Li and. Songrui. Liu, a pair of. Chinese researchers, wrote in a recent study. Such favoritism undermines economic efficiency and diverts resources from more dynamic private enterprises, they argued. Party authorities also have issued fresh warnings against \"formalism,\" or box-ticking behavior that cadres engage in to feign compliance with. Beijingbogging down the bureaucracy in unproductive work. The persistent slowdown in. China's economy magnifies both the stakes and challenges for the party. Xi's dominance \"has made it difficult for lower officials to make decisions because they are concerned about running into trouble,\" particularly given conflicting policy demands, said. Andrew. Collier, managing director of. Orient. Capital. Research in. Hong. Kong. \"They are at the difficult end of choices between paying for social services, economic development, and lowering debt levelsan impossible balancing act.\". Xi has signaled no retreat. \"The struggle against corruption will never end,\" the. Communist. Party's top antigraft body said in a recent commentary. \"It will only be ongoing, but never completed.\"",

         "Israeli Families Band Together to Keep Government Focused on Hostages\nSupport group transforms into collective campaign to win back Hamas’s captives\nNoam Idan Ben-Ezra, at the Tel Aviv plaza dubbed Hostage Square, campaigns for her brother’s return.\nBy Chao DengFollow\nand Carrie Keller-Lynn | Photographs by Ofir Berman for The Wall Street Journal\nUpdated Jan. 1, 2024 12:08 am ET\nSAVE\nSHARE\nTEXT\nListen to article\nLength\n(9 minutes)\nQueue\nExplore Audio Center\nTEL AVIV—For a full week in late December, Noam Idan Ben-Ezra and more than a dozen other relatives of hostages abducted by Hamas on Oct. 7 camped outside Israeli military headquarters and made their message inescapable.\nOnce every hour, the families and their supporters blocked vehicles from entering or exiting through the compound’s gate, while one read out the names of the 129 hostages still held in Gaza. The clock is ticking for their loved ones, they said, and Israel’s leaders need to do more to get them back.\nBen-Ezra, who had given up her job as a high-school administrator to fight for the return of her brother, 49-year-old software engineer Tsachi Idan, has been marking every day since his abduction.\n“It’s been 77 days. This has to end,” she said during the blockade on Dec. 22.\nFamilies of Israeli hostages, brought together by tragedy and a shared mission, have applied steady pressure on their government to make the return of captives its priority. Most relatives maintain that no Israeli offer to Hamas is too costly if it brings the hostages home. For nearly three months, they have carried out their campaign in the media, in protest gatherings and in meetings with decision makers in Israel and abroad. \nOn Thursday, representatives of 28 families met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who assured them he was doing all he could. President Biden hosted a smaller group in mid-December at the White House, where he told them U.S. efforts to bring everyone home wouldn’t cease. The White House at the time said that eight Americans remained captive inside Gaza. \nDowntown Tel Aviv, home of Israel’s military headquarters, has become a focal point for the campaign to bring hostages back from Gaza.\nHostage Square, in front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, draws crowds of supporters each week. PHOTO: OFIR BERMAN FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nHostage recovery has risen to the top of the Israeli government’s agenda because of the families, said Gideon Rahat, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n“If they were not there, maybe the goal of destroying Hamas would be No. 1, and this would be two or three,” he said.\nThe Netanyahu government must balance the pressure to recover the hostages with its declared goal of eradicating the threat of Hamas—an objective that also enjoys broad support in Israel following the Oct. 7 attack by the militant group on southern Israel. Furthering Israel’s challenge, militant groups other than Hamas are in control of some of the hostages.\nAdvertisement\nThe families concluded that their message to Israel’s leadership was getting through in November when Israel halted its assault on Gaza and set free Palestinian prisoners in a deal that led to the release of 105 of approximately 240 hostages.\nAfter that deal broke down, families kept up the pressure, and Israeli officials followed in December with an offer to Hamas to stop fighting for one week and allow more aid into Gaza in return for 40 more hostages. Hamas, a group the U.S. designates a terrorist organization, rejected the offer, in an effort to pressure Israel to offer more concessions. \nEgypt has since offered a full peace proposal—which Israel’s government has been giving serious attention because its first phase includes a hostage-prisoner exchange.\nWhen the war with Hamas began, Israeli families were initially grappling with the atrocities of the Oct. 7 attacks and struggling to find out the status of the missing. Israeli authorities eventually determined that around 1,200 people had been killed, most of them civilians.\nFamilies of hostages soon figured out they needed to band together. A group of Israeli lawyers, media strategists and former diplomats stepped up to help. The most immediate need, they determined, was a way for families to find each other and exchange information. They established a call center, which became a support group, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.\nAdvertisement\nDaniel Shek meets with the parents of abductee Omer Neutra at the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which has spread its campaign materials throughout Tel Aviv.\nAs Israel launched its assault in Gaza, Netanyahu quickly appointed a hostage coordinator. But it would take a week for the prime minister to meet with families whose relatives had been kidnapped.\nA collective effort by families to support each other and come up with ways to make their voices heard globally picked up. An Israeli tech businessman whose daughter was killed on Oct. 7 donated office space to the Families Forum, which attracted thousands of volunteers. \nWith the help of donations, the Forum spent several million dollars on advertisements on Google and Facebook, volunteers for the group said, and even bought screen time in New York’s Times Square. WhatsApp groups for the families started lighting up with updates on hostages and opportunities for relatives to appeal to media outlets and join delegations abroad. \nAdvertisement\nThe Forum has organized about 100 international trips for families to meet with officials in Europe and the U.S., as well as the World Health Organization and the United Nations, according to Daniel Shek, a former Israeli ambassador to France.\nShek got involved in the Forum early on, helping form a team of former diplomats and negotiators with experience in hostage situations. He said they have been able to float ideas to Israeli officials, while also contacting officials in the U.S., Europe and Egypt.\nA five-day walk in November from Tel Aviv to Netanyahu’s office in Jerusalem drew tens of thousands of supporters. Many families saw it as a turning point because a few days later, Israel struck the deal with Hamas to release dozens of women and children.\nThe families’ campaign can be seen throughout Tel Aviv, with posters identifying kidnapped Israelis on display on street corners and in the airport arrivals terminal. A plaza in front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art is now known as “Hostage Square,” with crowds, speeches and music every Saturday.\nAdvertisement\nAn empty dinner table set up in Hostage Square in Tel Aviv highlights the captives’ absence.\nEli Stivi, whose son was kidnapped by militants, says he wants Israel to resume talks to secure the release of more hostages.\nThe slogan “Bring Them Home Now” and paraphernalia such as yellow ribbons and black T-shirts featuring photos of hostages have helped attract supporters. Celebrities including Jerry Seinfeld have visited the plaza to show solidarity.\nThe families concede they have no influence over Hamas, which says Israel needs to implement a cease-fire before any hostage negotiations resume. Some relatives say Israel needs to do just that to bring Hamas to the table. Others have called on the government to bus thousands of Palestinian prisoners to the border with Gaza to make clear its willingness to pay for the release of its hostages.\nNetanyahu has said that unrelenting military pressure on Hamas is what will get the hostages back, and Israel has refused to pause fighting before negotiations.\nAdvertisement\nOn Dec. 15, the families were hit with another wave of anger and frustration when Israeli forces in Gaza mistakenly killed three Israeli hostages who had escaped.\nThat night, hundreds of relatives and supporters gathered outside the Kirya building—the Tel Aviv military headquarters, and where Israel’s cabinet meets on a regular basis. “I was screaming at them,” said Zohar Avigdori, who had welcomed two family members back from captivity in November. “If now is not the time to be mad, when is?”\nThe next day, the Families Forum helped set up about 20 tents outside the Kirya. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Benny Gantz, another member of Israel’s war cabinet, surprised families by coming to meet them at Hostage Square. Gantz offered assurances that Israel had the option to make a new offer to Hamas.\nOn Thursday, the Israeli military said it had determined that the killing of the three hostages was preventable and that it had shared its findings with soldiers to avoid another hostage tragedy.\nNetanyahu, meeting the families that day, tried to reassure them of Israel’s commitment to reaching a hostage deal. “We are holding contacts at this very moment,” he said, according to a statement about the meeting. “We are working to return them all. This is our goal.”\nAdvertisement\nAt the Kirya on a recent weekday, the families blocked the driveway at 29 minutes after each hour, to commemorate 6:29 a.m. on Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Israel. Their blockade lasted 241 seconds, representing the number of hostages taken into Gaza that day.\n“I came here because I want a new deal,” said Eli Stivi, whose son Idan was abducted in the attack on the Nova music festival. “I don’t want to stop the war, but I want to start the talks.”\nThe father, a tech entrepreneur, said he didn’t know whether his son was still alive. Of 129 hostages remaining in Gaza, 23 are dead, according to Israel.\nStivi said he thinks about whether Idan is cold, wherever he is. Stivi got into his white Mercedes to drive home for Shabbat dinner. He would return, he said, to sleep in a tent that night.\nWrite to Chao Deng at chao.deng@wsj.com\nConflict in the Middle East\nLatest news and key analysis, selected by editors\nChallenge to Hamas in Gaza Grows as Protests Enter Second Day\nPalestinian Film Director Released After Being Attacked by Israeli Settlers\nIsrael Is Killing Hamas Leaders in Quick Succession\nIn Gaza, Weddings Are Off and Restaurants Close Again as Cease-Fire Crumbles\nTurkey Detains Erdogan’s Top Rival in Raid on Opposition\nIsrael, Fighting Again in Gaza, Is Also at War at Home\nTrump’s Yemen Campaign Tests Promise to Avoid Forever Wars\nSyria to Integrate U.S.-Backed Kurdish Militia Into Armed Forces\nAdvertisement\nAppeared in the January 3, 2024, print edition as 'Families Band Together for Hostages'.",

PHOTO: TINGSHU WANG/REUTERS\nChina hawks have the upper hand in the political battle over electric vehicles. They should be wary of overplaying it.\nThe rules for getting a tax credit on EV purchases in the U.S. changed recently. One difference will help stimulate sales: The credit, worth up to $7,500, is now available at the point of sale rather than at the end of the tax year, meaning it can be used as part of a down payment. Other changes will have the opposite effect. Among new sourcing requirements designed to foster a North American supply chain, battery components manufactured in China, the world’s largest supplier, now make models ineligible.\nThe rear-wheel-drive and long-range versions of Tesla’s TSLA -1.67%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\nModel 3 just lost the credit as a result. So did the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevrolet Blazer EVs made by General Motors GM 0.75%\nincrease; green up pointing triangle\n, at least temporarily while the company accelerates alternative sourcing arrangements. Ford Motor’s Mustang Mach-E no longer qualifies for the half share of the subsidy.\nAlthough the rules have been known for well over a year as part of President Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the Treasury Department only came up with detailed guidance a few weeks ago. Carmakers generally wanted a looser view so that more EVs would qualify at a lower cost. So did many environmentalists, who are eager to see more affordable EVs. They were pitched in a lobbying battle against national-security hawks, who are worried about replacing a reliance on Saudi oil with battery supply chains dominated by China.\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nMarkets P.M.\nCatch up on the day's most important markets moves, delivered after the closing bell.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nIn the end, the bill’s interpretation reflected the same spirit of political compromise that brought it to law, but if anything it leans toward the hawks. Chinese companies have to own less than 25% of a battery-parts producer to avoid disqualifying a vehicle. This rules out all but the most lopsided joint ventures, though it does leave the door open to technology licensing—the approach Ford is pursuing with the Chinese battery giant CATL at a new plant in Michigan. \nEV tax credits aren’t the only evidence of how China hawks are prevailing in Washington. Just before Christmas, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Biden administration is considering an increase in import taxes on Chinese EVs, even though they are already high at 27.5% and hardly any Chinese EVs are currently imported (models by Polestar are an exception).\nAnd it isn’t just Washington. The French government recently introduced restrictions on its own EV subsidies that exclude products imported from China, such as those of the Chinese state automaker SAIC Motor 600104 -0.44%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\n, as well as Tesla’s Model 3, which is currently shipped to Europe from Shanghai. Paris framed its restriction as an environmental one, on the basis that made-in-China EVs cost a lot of carbon to make and bring to Europe.\nMeanwhile, the European Union is considering an increase in tariffs on EVs imported from China. A few months ago it launched an investigation into the potential “illegal subsidization” of EVs that might cause “economic injury” to its own producers. The most feared Chinese producer isn’t waiting for the results. Just before Christmas, BYD, China’s answer to Tesla, said it would build its first European car factory in Szeged, Hungary.\nBeijing itself continues to support the technology. In June, it said it would extend a tax break for EV purchases by another four years. In 2024 and 2025, the exemption will be worth 10% of the vehicle price or up to 30,000 yuan, equivalent to $4,200, after which it will be halved.\nExcluding Chinese companies from Western EV handouts is something politicians on both sides of the Atlantic can agree on. With 2024 set to be a record year for elections globally—Americans aren’t the only ones who will head to the polls—this seems unlikely to change. \nThe risk is that the West cuts off its nose to spite its face. Slow down the shift to EVs too much to build local supply chains and give domestic manufacturers time to adapt, and Chinese technology might simply pull farther ahead, supported by a huge, generously subsidized domestic market and exports to emerging economies.\nIt will be hard for the West to strike the right balance between protecting domestic supply chains and creating globally competitive ones.\nWrite to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com\nAdvertisement\nThe EV Transition\nMore coverage of the auto industry's challenging shift, selected by the editors\nBYD Shares Touch All-Time High After Unveiling New Charging Tech\nTesla Develops Cheaper Model Y to Battle Competition in China\nVolkswagen to Launch Low-Cost EV\nToyota to Set Up China EV Unit\nAppeared in the January 2, 2024, print edition as 'West Must Strike Balance on China EVs'.\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nMarine Le Pen Found Guilty of Embezzlement, Banned From Next Election\nIf Vaccines Don’t Cause Autism, What Does?\nMike Waltz Is Losing Support Inside the White House\nNo More Mr. Nice Guy.

Chinese companies have to own less than 25 of a battery-parts producer to avoid disqualifying a vehicle. This rules out all but the most lopsided joint ventures, though it does leave the door open to technology licensingthe approach. Ford is pursuing with the. Chinese battery giant. CATL at a new plant in. Michigan. EV tax credits aren't the only evidence of how. China hawks are prevailing in. Washington. Just before. Christmas,. The. Wall. Street. Journal reported that the. Biden administration is considering an increase in import taxes on. Chinese. EVs, even though they are already high at 27.5 and hardly any. Chinese. EVs are currently imported models an exception. And it isn't just. Washington. The. French government recently introduced restrictions on its own. EV subsidies that exclude products imported from. China, such as those of the. Chinese state automaker. SAIC. Motor 4 -0.44 decrease; red down pointing triangle , as well as. Tesla's. Model 3, which is currently shipped to. Europe from. Shanghai. Paris framed its restriction as an environmental one, on the basis that made-in-China. EVs cost a lot of carbon to make and bring to. Europe. Meanwhile, the. European. Union is considering an increase in tariffs on. EVs imported from. China. A few months ago it launched an investigation into the potential \"illegal subsidization\" of. EVs that might cause \"economic injury\" to its own producers. The most feared. Chinese producer isn't waiting for the results. Just before. Christmas,. BYD,. China's answer to. Tesla, said it would build its first. European car factory in. Szeged,. Hungary. Beijing itself continues to support the technology. In. June, it said it would extend a tax break for. EV purchases years. In and , the exemption will be worth 10 of the vehicle price or up to 30,000 yuan, equivalent to 4,200, after which it will be halved. Excluding. Chinese companies from. Western. EV handouts is something politicians on both sides of the. Atlantic can agree on. With set to be a record year for elections globallyAmericans aren't the only ones who will head to the pollsthis seems unlikely to change. The risk is that the. West cuts off its nose to spite its face. Slow down the shift to. EVs too much to build local supply chains and give domestic manufacturers time to adapt, and. Chinese technology might simply pull farther ahead, supported by a huge, generously subsidized domestic market and exports to emerging economies. It will be hard for the. West to strike the right balance between protecting domestic supply chains and creating globally competitive ones. Volkswagen to. Launch. Low-Cost. EV. No. More. Mr. Nice. Guy. In. Fighting. Trump,.

Likewise, U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, are set to hit a record in December, according to market intelligence firm Kpler. European countries have snapped up more U.S. cargoes in recent months, becoming less reliant on shipments through the Suez Canal, a key Red Sea artery.    \nThe attacks on vessels, which the Houthis say are in retaliation for the Israeli military operation in Gaza, have intensified in recent days. U.S. officials alleged a Dec. 23 attack drone launched directly from Iran struck a Japanese-owned chemical tanker off the coast of India, though Tehran denied that claim.\nThe shipping crisis is expected to raise consumer prices for goods that cross the Red Sea, as hundreds of vessels have been forced to reroute around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. But it is unfolding just as U.S. frackers have caught a second wind that, so far, has countered inflationary effects in energy. \nMany forecasters expected U.S. oil production to grow only modestly in 2023 as frackers responded to investor pleas for conservative spending, allowing the companies to pay off debt and fund dividends and share buybacks. \nIt isn’t entirely clear how long shale companies can keep increasing production at the same fast clip. Shale drillers, especially privately held companies, deployed more rigs in late 2022 in response to higher commodity prices driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The scope and duration of those advances are unclear.\nU.S. oil production had grown to about 13.2 million barrels a day as of October, up almost 900,000 barrels a day from the same month in 2022, according to the Energy Information Administration’s latest available data.\nMeanwhile drillers in Guyana and Brazil also swiftly increased their output in 2023, though neither gained as much as U.S. shale.  \nAll of that has kept the world’s oil inventories far more flush than traders expected months ago, subduing oil prices. In response, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies moved in November to cut output further to prop up prices. U.S. crude prices have dropped about 21% in the fourth quarter, and were down about 6% in December.  \nOne beneficiary of cheaper oil: President Biden, whose Energy Department has recently accelerated its purchases of crude meant to replace the barrels it sold off in 2022 from the nation’s strategic petroleum reserve. The government had sold the barrels at higher prices that year, and is now competing more actively with international oil buyers.\nTankers have recently carried more U.S. crude to the Netherlands, the U.K., Italy, Spain, France, Germany and other countries as more of Russia’s crude has flowed to Asia following Western sanctions. U.S. oil shipments to Europe have jumped 34% since this time in 2022 and 82% from before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Kpler data show.\nLonger term, the Red Sea situation could bring more business for U.S. LNG shippers, which are building out export capacity at Gulf Coast facilities and are vying for lengthy contracts with big buyers in Europe, analysts said.\nShale drillers such as Range Resources have helped push the U.S. to record levels of natural gas production.

At the same time, American LNG exports are expected to rise to a record of more than 8 million metric tons in December, up from the previous record of 7.7 million in October, Kpler projected.\nAdvocates for fracking have long said fast-growing U.S. shale production could help stabilize markets in times of crisis, in part, because of the speed with which a shale well produces. But analysts warned shale’s market influence would diminish if Iran became directly embroiled in the conflict. \n“When you’re talking about a minor disruption here or there, surging U.S. production helps,” said Robert McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy. “But Iran is a problem shale can’t solve, because Iran threatens the Strait of Hormuz, through which 18 million barrels a day flows.” \nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nHow will conflict in the Middle East affect the oil industry?

However, VW has yet to produce an EV that has matched the success of its historic gas-powered models such as the Beetle and the Golf in its core markets. \nSales of its electric flagship, the ID. series, have disappointed. So VW decided against scrapping the 50-year-old Golf, and it is developing an all-electric version that the company said could be launched by the end of the decade.\nBuilding and selling the electric car for “everyman” remains a core mission of Volkswagen, which translates as “people’s car.” In an attempt to reinvigorate VW’s mass appeal, the company is in the midst of a major restructuring so that it can produce profitable, desirable electric vehicles. \n“VW also wants to get very young people excited about the brand,” said Oliver Blume, who has the dual role as chief executive of Porsche and CEO of the entire VW company, which includes VW, Porsche, Audi, Bentley and Lamborghini, in emailed comments.\nOther automakers, such as General Motors and Ford Motor, have also been paring their electric ambitions, with some scaling back their production plans.\n\nIn VW’s case, Blume has launched a plan to slash 10 billion euros in costs, equivalent to around $11 billion, halt plans to build a new ultramodern EV factory in Wolfsburg and postpone plans for further battery plants in Europe.  \nThe cuts are aimed at lowering the cost of making vehicles, which would boost earnings and give VW more flexibility to lower prices for entry-level EV buyers. Earlier this year the company unveiled the ID. 2all, a small hatchback that the company says will sell for less than €25,000 and is one of 10 new EVs that VW is slated to launch by 2026. \n“As a young man I was also an enthusiastic Beetle and Polo driver. And there are very many customers who have such positive experiences and develop a close connection to the Volkswagen brand,” Blume said. \nOliver Blume, chief executive of the broader Volkswagen company, has launched a plan to slash €10 billion in costs. PHOTO: KRISZTIAN BOCSI/BLOOMBERG NEWS\nBlume said the company was working to develop a more affordable EV that could sell for €20,000 in the second half of the decade, a move to counter Chinese and other competitors entering the European market with cheap EVs.\nVW executives have warned staff of a tough year ahead.\n“The situation is very critical,” Thomas Schäfer, CEO of VW’s namesake brand, told labor representatives at a meeting in Wolfsburg at the end of November, according to a transcript seen by The Wall Street Journal. “With many of our current structures, processes and high costs, we are no longer competitive.”\nVW said on Dec. 19 that it had reached an agreement with union representatives to slash labor costs in administration by 20% through early retirement, expanding buyouts and not filling positions made vacant by retirements. \nThe impact of these measures could provide “a positive contribution to earnings totaling 10 billion euros,” VW said in a statement, with the aim of doubling the profit margin of the VW brand to 6.5% by 2026.\nIn addition to reducing the workforce, VW has also scrapped plans for new buildings and plans to speed up the time it takes to get products to market, by offering fewer feature options and slashing new model development time to 36 months from 50 months now. \nVW remains a combustion-engine behemoth: The company said it sold 8.3 million vehicles worldwide in the first 11 months of the year, a gain of about 12% from a year ago. \nVW has also taken strides as it shifts its business away from conventional cars. With all brands and models combined, the company has a 20% share of new EV sales in Europe this year, according to data from ev-volumes.com, ahead of Stellantis and Tesla—an edge VW hopes it can soon extend to the rest of the world. \nEVs from the company’s VW brand are losing market share in Europe, according to a report on sales through October by ev-volumes analyst José Pontes. He said the VW brand now has about 8.2% of the market, slightly behind BMW and trailing Tesla, which has 12% market share.\nVW has scrapped plans for new buildings and aims to slash new model development time. PHOTO: MARTIN DIVISEK/SHUTTERSTOCK\nTesla has the bestselling all-electric models in Europe but, after a rocky start, VW’s ID. 3 and ID. 4 all-electric cars, the Audi Q4 e-tron and Skoda’s Enyaq iV—also a VW brand—are gaining traction. Amid its push to get those models to market, VW has dealt with high costs, low productivity, launch delays caused by substandard software and a shaky global economy.  \nBlume is overhauling the software unit, Cariad, which has struggled to supply software on time to meet the deadlines for product launches, forcing Audi and Porsche to delay model launches. \nEarlier this year, Blume reshuffled the unit’s management and launched a restructuring program to accelerate software development. The unit will focus development on near-term launches of group vehicles and move more visionary and complicated software projects—such as autonomous vehicle software—to the back burner.\nAdvertisement\nIn China, a new generation of homegrown low-cost, high-tech electric models have overtaken the German company’s EVs in the country, which accounted for about 34% of its sales in the first 11 months of the year. So far this year, VW sales barely grew in China, its weakest showing in major markets worldwide. The new Chinese competition is also targeting Germany and Europe.\nAlthough VW produces vehicles in China, its EVs tend to be more expensive than its Chinese competition. Analysts said VW failed to offer midrange EVs that are in high demand in China and misread Chinese consumers’ preferences, which prize high-tech gadgets in their cars. \nTo claw back lost market share, VW has invested in the Chinese startup XPeng to acquire technology for new vehicles that will come to market in the next few years. VW is also building up huge R&D facilities with Chinese software engineers in the country.\n“A car company can’t be turned around in one year, but with our medium and long-term measures we are on the right course,” Blume said. \nVW cars on an elevator platform inside a tower used as storage in Wolfsburg.

The impact of these measures could provide \"a positive contribution to earnings totaling 10 billion euros,\". VW said in a statement, with the aim of doubling the profit margin of the. VW brand to 6.5 by . In addition to reducing the workforce,. VW has also scrapped plans for new buildings and plans to speed up the time it takes to get products to market, feature options and slashing new model development time to 36 months from 50 months now. VW remains a combustion-engine behemoth. The company said it sold 8.3 million vehicles worldwide in the first 11 months of the year, a gain of about 12 from a year ago. VW has also taken strides as it shifts its business away from conventional cars. With all brands and models combined, the company has a 20 of new. EV sales in. Europe this year, according to data from ev-volumes.com, ahead of. Stellantis and. Teslaan edge. VW hopes it can soon extend to the rest of the world. EVs from the company's. VW brand are losing market in. Europe, according to a report on sales through. October by ev-volumes analyst. Jos. Pontes. He said the. VW brand now has about 8.2 of the market, slightly behind. BMW and trailing. Tesla, which has 12 market . VW has scrapped plans for new buildings and aims to slash new model development time. Tesla has the bestselling all-electric models in. Europe but, after a rocky start,. VW's. ID. 3 and. ID. 4 all-electric cars, the. Audi. Q4 e-tron and. Skoda's. Enyaq iValso a. VW brandare gaining traction. Amid its push to get those models to market,. VW has dealt with high costs, low productivity, launch delays caused and a shaky global economy. Blume is overhauling the software unit,. Cariad, which has struggled to supply software on time to meet the deadlines for product launches, forcing. Audi and. Porsche to delay model launches. Earlier this year,. Blume reshuffled the unit's management and launched a restructuring program to accelerate software development. The unit will focus development on near-term launches of group vehicles and move more visionary and complicated software projectssuch as autonomous vehicle softwareto the back burner. In. China, a new generation of homegrown low-cost, high-tech electric models have overtaken the. German company's. EVs in the country, which accounted for about 34 of its sales in the first 11 months of the year. So far this year,. VW sales barely grew in. China, its weakest showing in major markets worldwide. The new. Chinese competition is also targeting. Germany and. Europe. Although. VW produces vehicles in. China, its. EVs tend to be more expensive than its. Chinese competition. Analysts said. VW failed to offer midrange. EVs that are in high demand in. China and misread. Chinese consumers' preferences, which prize high-tech gadgets in their cars. To claw back lost market ,. VW has invested in the. Chinese startup. XPeng to acquire technology for new vehicles that will come to market in the next few years. VW is also building up huge. RD facilities with.

         "Markets Coverage\nThe latest news & analysis\nLIVE\nAcross the Markets\nEconomy\nStreetwise\nStocks\nQuick Takes\nMarket Data\nYour Money\nNewsletter Signup\nThe Tax Whiz With the Strangest Hustle on Wall Street\nInvesting in tax deals requires smarts and lots of patience\nAndy Lee and Taco, his five-year-old Corgi.\nBy\nBen Foldy\nFollow\n| Photographs by Clark Hodgin for The Wall Street Journal\nJan. 1, 2024 7:00 am ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(7 min)\nAndy Lee is the king of a lucrative niche in the financial markets. Being king isn’t easy.\nLee invests in tax receivable agreements, increasingly common arrangements that put cash into the pockets of early investors in companies. Not many investors know how they work, and a surprising number of people don’t even know they have them.\nThat gives Lee an opening to buy up the cash flows from TRAs, as they are known, at a discount and count his winnings as they pay off. To get to that point requires deep knowledge of taxes, investing and the law, plus lots of persistence.\n\nTo close a recent deal, Lee needed to obtain wet signatures, meaning handwritten, from as many as 114 people in seven days. “I want to punch myself in the face,” Lee said. “It’s not rocket science, but there aren’t many people in finance who like to do this kind of thing.” \nLee, 33 years old, seeks to turn tax receivable agreements into a new asset class.\nLee does. He has an average of 32 conversations a week in hopes of drumming up deals. He has pursued prospective sellers to extreme ends, once running a charity 5K race in hopes of pitching a deal to its guest of honor, a TRA holder. \nLee, 33 years old, founded Parallaxes Capital in 2017, creating a fund that seeks to turn TRAs into a new asset class by creating a secondary market for investors.\n“In a relatively small and not super well-known space, Andy is by far the biggest fish in that pond,” said Albert Chang, head of M&A, tax and structuring advisory at RBC Capital Markets.\nLee often starts with cold outreaches to people with TRAs who are surprised to hear from him. One company founder responded to Lee’s pitch with a cry laughing emoji. “I don’t know what a TRA is, so probably not for me,” the founder said.\nLee had the public financial filings to prove the founder had a TRA and a price Parallaxes would pay for its future cash flows. Through thousands of conversations and one-on-one deals like these, Parallaxes has invested more than $300 million across four funds. It is currently raising two more.\nAs Lee pitches TRA holders, he educates potential investors. “I got the deck sent to me and at first I didn’t really understand what this was,” said Gilbert Calderon, chief investment officer at M4 Capital Management, a single-family office in Chicago known for buying esoteric investments. M4 eventually signed on.\nOther early investors included endowments that understood TRAs because they were themselves beneficiaries. One family office sold its own TRA payment rights to Parallaxes. It took a stake in the firm’s first fund instead of cash.\nLee’s Parallaxes Capital has invested more than $300 million across four funds.\nParallaxes’s first two funds have returned about 15% annually, according to investors. Later funds have done better because some companies whose TRA rights they owned were acquired and the TRAs were paid out early.\nTRAs are mostly used to unlock tax advantages when businesses structured as partnerships or limited-liability companies go public. The pre-initial-public-offering investors maintain an interest in the original operating company while the new shareholders own stock in a new publicly traded entity, which then holds shares in the operating company.\nWhen the original investors sell, their stakes in the operating company become new shares in the publicly traded holding company. This triggers the creation of the tax asset, which can reduce the company’s tax bill. \nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWhat’s News\nCatch up on the headlines, understand the news and make better decisions, free in your inbox daily. Enjoy a free article in every edition.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nA TRA splits those savings with the early investors, offsetting some of the tax bill from their sales. Nearly all TRAs split the tax assets 85/15 between the investor and company, in what is billed as a win-win for both parties. These payments to pre-IPO owners usually stretch over 15 years. \nParallaxes offers TRA beneficiaries cash up front in exchange for those potential future payments. The deals are similar to upfront payments for structured lawsuit settlements or winning lottery tickets that pay off over time. In its median deal, Parallaxes offers a TRA holder about $4 million and typically anticipates getting back 2.5 times its investment. \nInvestors like TRA cash flows because they have tax advantages over bonds and aren’t highly correlated to public markets. But if a company doesn’t produce big-enough profits or if tax rates go down, the TRA payouts could take longer or be less than expected. The biggest threat to a TRA is bankruptcy. \nLee started college at 16, attending the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where his father had received a Ph.D. in computer science and his mother a master’s degree in accounting with a focus on taxes. Lee graduated with a job offer to join Citigroup in New York as an analyst. \nAdvertisement\nBut his father would only cosign Lee’s lease in New York if he earned a graduate degree. Lee chose the same accounting master’s his mother did because it required little in-person attendance and had an open-book final exam. \nAt Citigroup, Lee worked on a transaction where Cloud Peak Energy, a coal producer spun off from mining company Rio Tinto, pushed its former parent to sell its TRA obligation at a steep discount. Lee realized that Cloud Peak was essentially paying 36 cents for every $1 of cash flow that would accrue under the TRA. \nLee left Citigroup for private-equity firm Lone Star Funds, where he was tasked with coming up with new investment ideas. He pitched a fund that would invest in tax receivable agreements. His bosses at Lone Star, with $86 billion under management, balked at the small size of the market. \nLee founded his own fund after stints with Citigroup and private-equity firm Lone Star Funds.\nLone Star encouraged him to start his own fund, and some of the firm’s partners were among his first investors, Lee said. \nThen the hard work of finding investments began. Building substantial positions in specific TRAs can mean tracking down dozens of people and persuading them each individually to sell their TRA rights.\nThe firm finds people in public filings and plans its sales pitch. Lee likes to take people on walks with Taco, his five-year-old Corgi. He will hire athletes to make short Cameo videos to nudge deals over the line.

         "The latest news analysis. Andy. Lee and. Taco, his five-year-old. Corgi. Photographs for. The. Wall. Street. Journal. Jan. 1, 700 am. ET 7 min. Andy. Lee is the king of a lucrative niche in the financial markets. Being king isn't easy. Lee invests in tax receivable agreements, increasingly common arrangements that put cash into the pockets of early investors in companies. Not many investors know how they work, and a surprising number of people don't even know they have them. That gives. Lee an opening to buy up the cash flows from. TRAs, as they are known, at a discount and count his winnings as they pay off. To get to that point requires deep knowledge of taxes, investing and the law, plus lots of persistence. To close a recent deal,. Lee needed to obtain wet signatures, meaning handwritten, from as many as 114 people in seven days. \"I want to punch myself in the face,\". Lee said. \"It's not rocket science, but there aren't many people in finance who like to do this kind of thing.\". Lee, 33 years old, seeks to turn tax receivable agreements into a new asset class. Lee does. He has an average of 32 conversations a week in hopes of drumming up deals. He has pursued prospective sellers to extreme ends, once running a charity 5K race in hopes of pitching a deal to its guest of honor, a. TRA holder. Lee, 33 years old, founded. Parallaxes. Capital in , creating a fund that seeks to turn. TRAs into a new asset class by creating a secondary market for investors. \"In a relatively small and not super well-known space,. Andy is biggest fish in that pond,\" said. Albert. Chang, head of. MA, tax and structuring advisory at. RBC. Capital. Markets. Lee often starts with cold outreaches to people with. TRAs who are surprised to hear from him. One company founder responded to. Lee's pitch with a cry laughing emoji. \"I don't know what a. TRA is, so probably not for me,\" the founder said. Lee had the public financial filings to prove the founder had a. TRA and a price. Parallaxes would pay for its future cash flows. Through thousands of conversations and one-on-one deals like these,. Parallaxes has invested more than 300 million across four funds. It is currently raising two more. As. Lee pitches. TRA holders, he educates potential investors. \"I got the deck sent to me and at first. I didn't really understand what this was,\" said. Gilbert. Calderon, chief investment officer at. M4. Capital. Management, a single-family office in. Chicago known for buying esoteric investments. M4 eventually signed on. Other early investors included endowments that understood. TRAs because they were themselves beneficiaries. One family office sold its own. TRA payment rights to. Parallaxes. It took a stake in the firm's first fund instead of cash. Lee's. Parallaxes. Capital has invested more than 300 million across four funds. Parallaxes's first two funds have returned about 15 annually, according to investors. Later funds have done better because some companies whose. TRA rights they owned were acquired and the. TRAs were paid out early. TRAs are mostly used to unlock tax advantages when businesses structured as partnerships or limited-liability companies go public. The pre-initial-public-offering investors maintain an interest in the original operating company while the new shareholders own stock in a new publicly traded entity, which then holds shares in the operating company. When the original investors sell, their stakes in the operating company become new shares in the publicly traded holding company. This triggers the creation of the tax asset, which can reduce the company's tax bill. A. TRA splits those savings with the early investors, offsetting some of the tax bill from their sales. Nearly all. TRAs split the tax assets 8515 between the investor and company, in what is billed as a win-win for both parties. These payments to pre-IPO owners usually stretch over 15 years. Parallaxes offers. TRA beneficiaries cash up front in exchange for those potential future payments. The deals are similar to upfront payments for structured lawsuit settlements or winning lottery tickets that pay off over time. In its median deal,. Parallaxes offers a. TRA holder about 4 million and typically anticipates getting back 2.5 times its investment. Investors like. TRA cash flows because they have tax advantages over bonds and aren't highly correlated to public markets. But if a company doesn't produce big-enough profits or if tax rates go down, the. TRA payouts could take longer or be less than expected. The biggest threat to a. TRA is bankruptcy. Lee started college at 16, attending the. University of. Illinois. Urbana-Champaign, where his father had received a. Ph.D. in computer science and his mother a master's degree in accounting with a focus on taxes. Lee graduated with a job offer to join. Citigroup in. New. York as an analyst. But his father would only cosign. Lee's lease in. New. York if he earned a graduate degree. Lee chose the same accounting master's his mother did because it required little in-person attendance and had an open-book final exam. At. Citigroup,. Lee worked on a transaction where. Cloud. Peak. Energy, a coal producer spun off from mining company. Rio. Tinto, pushed its former parent to sell its. TRA obligation at a steep discount. Lee realized that. Cloud. Peak was essentially paying 36 cents for every 1 of cash flow that would accrue under the. TRA. Lee left. Citigroup for private-equity firm. Lone. Star. Funds, where he was tasked with coming up with new investment ideas. He pitched a fund that would invest in tax receivable agreements. His bosses at. Lone. Star, with 86 billion under management, balked at the small size of the market. Lee founded his own fund after stints with. Citigroup and private-equity firm. Lone. Star. Funds. Lone. Star encouraged him to start his own fund, and some of the firm's partners were among his first investors,. Lee said. Then the hard work of finding investments began. Building substantial positions in specific. TRAs can mean tracking down dozens of people and persuading them each individually to sell their. TRA rights. The firm finds people in public filings and plans its sales pitch. Lee likes to take people on walks with. Taco, his five-year-old. Corgi. He will hire athletes to make short. Cameo to nudge deals over the line. One. Duke. University alumnus got a message from. Jay. Williamsstar point guard of the school's national-champion, men's basketball teamimploring him to sell his.

         "China’s Xi Is Resurrecting Mao’s ‘Continuous Revolution’ With a Twist\nThe Chinese leader has made his corruption purge—with millions punished—a pillar of his rule. It risks paralyzing his party.\nChinese leader Xi Jinping recently met with senior officers of the armed forces stationed in Nanning, southern China. LI GANG/XINHUA/ZUMA PRESS\nBy Chun Han WongFollow\nUpdated Jan. 1, 2024 12:08 am ET\nSAVE\nSHARE\nTEXT\n386 RESPONSES\nListen to article\n(10 minutes)\nChinese rulers have long used campaigns against corruption to sideline rivals and consolidate power. Xi Jinping is increasingly tying his authority to a new variation: a purge that never ends.\nWith echoes of Mao Zedong’s “continuous revolution,” Xi has sent fear rippling through the ranks of the Communist Party for more than a decade with the largest campaign against corruption in modern Chinese history. It is now threatening to petrify the party as it tries to steer the world’s second-largest economy through its greatest period of uncertainty in a generation.\nSince he came to power in 2012, party enforcers have punished roughly five million people for offenses as serious as abuse of power and as innocuous as creating excessive red tape.\nIn 2023 alone, the unrelenting campaign swept through the worlds of finance, food, healthcare, semiconductors and sports—taking down scores of senior officials, bankers, hospital directors and even soccer administrators. China’s foreign and defense ministers went missing in the summer before being abruptly removed from their posts, leading to suspicions that they, too, have been purged. Beijing’s recent ouster of a dozen senior military and defense-industry officials from the national legislature and a government advisory body have fueled speculation about a broader shake-up of the country’s military establishment.\nLi Shangfu hasn’t made a public appearance since late August and U.S. officials say the Chinese Defense Minister is being ousted from his post. Li is the latest of several senior Chinese officials to disappear without explanation. Photo: How Hwee Young/Shutterstock\nThere is no end in sight. The Chinese leader recently outlined his plans for how the campaign would proceed in the next few years and has even targeted the very agency tasked with carrying it out.\nCritics of Xi say the campaign’s extension into a second decade is a result of his refusal to accept structural changes and greater transparency that are necessary for cleaner governance. \nAn anticorruption campaign in China is extending into a second decade as its economy, the world’s second largest, faces several challenges. PHOTO: NG HAN GUAN/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe Chinese leader has instead cast the blame on the moral failings of individuals, while doubling down on his centralized and opaque style of governance, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Xi’s remarks, party directives and official data. Only a continual cleansing can ensure the party remains potent and pure, he has argued.\n“Battling corruption is the most thorough form of self-revolution,” Xi said days before starting his third term as party chief in October 2022. “As long as the soil and conditions conducive for corruption continue to exist, the fight against corruption can’t cease for a moment.”\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWSJ China\nExclusive insights on the contest between the U.S. and China, brought to you by the WSJ’s top China correspondent.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nSuch an assertion clears the way for Xi to use disciplinary purges indefinitely as a way to enforce fealty, through fear, to himself and his vision.\n“In China, campaigns are supposed to be an intense but short burst of enforcement,” said Yuen Yuen Ang, a political-science professor at Johns Hopkins University. “Xi has invented a paradoxical policy tool: a perpetual campaign.”\nWhile the forever purge buttresses Xi’s authority, it also has instilled a constant apprehension and reluctance to act decisively among party members as challenges mount. The economy is struggling to shake its Covid hangover. Youth unemployment has skyrocketed, and the property market and consumer sentiment have tanked. Meanwhile, debt is piling up and foreign investors are increasingly turning their backs on the Chinese market.\nAdvertisement\nIn the early years of the campaign, many officials saw it as a longer and more ambitious version of previous efforts. Roughly 180,000 people were disciplined for infractions in 2013, a number that climbed to some 621,000 in 2018, the year Xi proclaimed a “crushing victory” over corruption.\nOfficial data show at least half a million people being disciplined every year since 2017—around four times as many as were typically punished annually when Xi’s predecessor held power from 2002 to 2012. \nBy some measures, corruption has indeed fallen under Xi. Berlin-based advocacy group Transparency International ranked China 65th in its 2022 index on perceptions of public-sector corruption in 180 countries and territories, an improvement from 80th out of 176 jurisdictions in 2012, the year Xi took power. \nAdvertisement\nA survey published in 2020 by Harvard University’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation found that the proportion of Chinese citizens who saw officials as being generally “clean” rose to more than 65% in 2016 from roughly 35% in 2011. \nXi Jinping has outlined plans for how his anticorruption campaign would proceed in the next few years. PHOTO: NOEL CELIS/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nThere are other indications, however, that Xi hasn’t curbed corruption so much as pushed it deeper into the shadows. The new five-year plan for fighting graft released in September pledges to curb new and hidden forms of corruption where officials use murky corporate structures and “revolving doors” between the public and private sectors to seek illicit gains.\nA recent case involving Zhang Jing, a former local official in southwestern China, shows corruption has remained insidious and persistent. Zhang’s offenses date to the early 2000s, when as a township party chief, he started accepting “red envelopes” of cash from entrepreneurs and friends in return for providing inside information about government projects, according to an official account.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nCan Xi Jinping’s strategy guide China through economic crisis? Join the conversation below.\nWhen one of those entrepreneurs was detained by authorities in 2013, Zhang grew frightened, to the point of asking a feng shui master to pray for his safety, according to the account. He tried to cover his tracks, such as by returning a bribe to one entrepreneur through a bank transfer—so that he could cite bank records to plead innocence—before taking the bribe again in cash later.\nAuthorities didn’t catch up with Zhang until 2022, when the party detained and eventually expelled him. In March 2023, he was sentenced to four years in jail after being found to have taken more than 1.24 million yuan worth of bribes, equivalent to around $175,000 at current rates.\n“I didn’t pull back from the precipice and confess to the organization in time,” he said in his confession. “Instead I racked my brains to try to cover up my crimes.”\nAdvertisement\nInvestigations involving more visible forms of corruption have fallen in recent years, according to official data. People punished for dining on public money dropped to around 9,300 in 2022 from 13,600 in 2018, and those disciplined for holding lavish events such as weddings and banquets slipped below 3,000 from 7,000 over the same period.\nMeanwhile, the number of people disciplined for improper giving and receiving of gifts—a more hidden form of graft—have steadily climbed, rising to 23,000 in 2022 from about 6,800 in 2015.\nThe party’s top internal watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, has warned about a growing trend of “options corruption”—named after a type of financial contract—whereby crooked cadres provide favors in return for deferred bribes to be paid out only after they retire, as a way to mask their misconduct.\nDespite his efforts to fight graft, which include cutting government approvals and red tape that officials can abuse to extract bribes, Xi hasn’t enacted deeper structural changes—such as asset disclosures—that experts in clean government say are needed to attack corruption at its root. \nAdvertisement\nXi seems to accept some levels of graft as an unavoidable consequence of sustaining one-party rule, some analysts say, whereby corruption is to be suppressed—rather than eradicated—through eternal vigilance.\nCommunist Party enforcers have punished millions for offenses as serious as abuse of power and as innocuous as creating excessive red tape since Xi came to power in 2012. PHOTO: WANG YE/XINHUA/ZUMA PRESS\nFor Xi, “it is all about attitude and mental disposition, not about institutional checks and balances,” according to Daniel Leese, a professor of Chinese history at the University of Freiburg.\nLeese and other historians say Xi’s perpetual purges are inspired in part by Mao’s ideas on waging “continuous revolution,” which were meant to avert ideological atrophy in the party and broader society. \nBut whereas Mao roused ordinary Chinese into purging class enemies and assaulting what he saw as a decaying party from the outside, Xi has shaken up the party from within, using fear to enforce virtuous behavior. Even the party’s discipline inspectors themselves have become targets, under a rectification campaign launched in February that aims to “turn the blade inward and cut out decaying flesh.”\nAdvertisement\nThe point is to maintain constant pressure, according to Leese. “There is simply no way of reaching a final stop with this model,” he said.\nWhile it has helped Xi accumulate a level of power unseen since Mao, party insiders say his “rule-by-fear” approach has stifled policy debate and fueled indecision among lower-level officials at a time when China requires more decisive leadership to deal with long-term challenges. \nA ‘rule-by-fear’ approach has helped Xi Jinping accumulate a level of power unseen since Mao Zedong. PHOTO: JADE GAO/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nThe fear is leading bureaucrats to act timidly, with potentially significant impact on the economy, researchers say. “Officials are more inclined to provide favors to [state-owned enterprises], thereby reducing their career risks because such allocations do not imply corruption,” Zeren Li and Songrui Liu, a pair of Chinese researchers, wrote in a recent study. Such favoritism undermines economic efficiency and diverts resources from more dynamic private enterprises, they argued. \nParty authorities also have issued fresh warnings against “formalism,” or box-ticking behavior that cadres engage in to feign compliance with Beijing—bogging down the bureaucracy in unproductive work.\nThe persistent slowdown in China’s economy magnifies both the stakes and challenges for the party. Xi’s dominance “has made it difficult for lower officials to make decisions because they are concerned about running into trouble,” particularly given conflicting policy demands, said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research in Hong Kong. “They are at the difficult end of choices between paying for social services, economic development, and lowering debt levels—an impossible balancing act.”\nXi has signaled no retreat.\n“The struggle against corruption will never end,” the Communist Party’s top antigraft body said in a recent commentary. “It will only be ongoing, but never completed.”\nWrite to Chun Han Wong at chunhan.wong@wsj.com\nU.S.-China Tensions\nTracking the complicated relationship of the world's two largest economies\nPODCAST SERIES: CHINA BUILDS INFLUENCE WITH INFRASTRUCTURE\nThe Warship That Shows Why the U.S. Navy Is Falling Behind China\nChina’s Xi Is Angered by Panama Port Deal Trump Touted as a Win\nInside the Chinese Region That Has Become a No-Go for Western Companies\nChinese Ships Are Carrying America’s Cargo.

Now He’s Accused of an Affair With Her.\nThe district attorney brought Nathan Wade on to prosecute the former president—but he lacks experience trying felony cases, lawyers say\nBy\nMariah Timms\nFollow\n,\nJan Wolfe\nFollow\nand\nCameron McWhirter\nFollow\nJan. 10, 2024 6:48 pm ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(7 min)\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade PHOTO: JOHN BAZEMORE/ASSOCIATED PRESS; JASON GETZ/PRESS POOL\nATLANTA—Allegations that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis engaged in an improper relationship with Nathan Wade, a special prosecutor on her team that brought racketeering charges against Donald Trump and others, are focusing attention on the Atlanta attorney with little previous criminal trial experience.\nThere exists no record that Wade, a lawyer in private practice hired to lead the Trump case, has ever handled a felony trial in Georgia, according to a filing Monday by a co-defendant in the Trump case.\nThe filing alleges that Wade and Willis have been in a continuing romantic relationship that predates her hiring him. While the filing didn’t provide evidence of a romantic relationship, it makes a bombshell claim: that Willis hired her alleged boyfriend, and they both financially benefited from the arrangement.\nThe motion Monday stunned Atlanta’s tightknit legal community and injected uncertainty into one of the highest-profile prosecutions in the country. Lawyers in Georgia say at a minimum, the allegations in the Monday filing raise questions about why Willis sought Wade’s services.\n“My understanding is that he has no felony jury trial experience,” said Chris Timmons, an Atlanta defense lawyer who has prosecuted cases under the same racketeering law used against Trump, known as a RICO statute.\nWade isn’t qualified to serve as a court-appointed defense lawyer in the Trump case, according to Monday’s motion. To pick up such an assignment, a lawyer needs to have tried “at least two criminal trials of similar offenses,” according to a 2022 document from the Fulton County Superior Court.\nWade’s lack of relevant experience “would be concerning in any complex felony case, let alone one that is a multi-defendant RICO case,” said Timmons, an ABC News contributor.\nFulton County special prosecutor Nathan Wade last year in court. PHOTO: ALYSSA POINTER/GETTY IMAGES\nA spokesman for Willis didn’t respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Previously, the spokesman said Willis’s office would respond to the allegations in its own filing. Willis’s office hadn’t filed a response as of Wednesday afternoon.\nNathan Wade didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment left on the voicemail at his law office.\nWade’s two-person law firm, Wade & Campbell, handles a range of legal matters from divorces to car accident disputes, according to Wade’s online bio.\nAfter graduating from Atlanta’s John Marshall Law School, Wade worked briefly as an assistant solicitor for Georgia’s Cobb County in 1999, prosecuting misdemeanor cases. He later became a municipal judge in the Atlanta suburb of Marietta, hearing misdemeanor cases and traffic offenses. Between 2012 and 2016, Wade ran three times—unsuccessfully—for a judgeship on the Cobb County Superior Court.\nWade has been paid nearly $654,000 in legal fees by Willis’s office since January 2022, according to Fulton County financial records. The last payment to his firm shown in those records is from early October; if Wade continued to receive payments at a similar rate to the rest of the contract, he could have earned close to $1 million, according to the motion. \nWade has frequently appeared in court in the Trump case. At a Dec. 1 hearing, Wade responded to arguments by Trump’s lawyer that a trial in late 2024 would interfere with the election. “The district attorney has made it clear that she has no interest in interfering or getting involved with this presidential election,” Wade said.\nFormer President Donald Trump departing the Fulton County Jail after turning himself into authorities on Aug. 24, 2023. PHOTO: ERIK S. LESSER/ZUMA PRESS\nWillis and Wade have moved in the same legal circles for years, including overlapping terms as municipal court judges in the Atlanta area.\nMonday’s filing alleged Willis awarded Wade a taxpayer-funded salary he has used to pay for trips he took with Willis to Napa Valley and the Caribbean.\nAshleigh Merchant, the lawyer who researched and wrote the filing, said sealed records from Wade’s divorce proceeding from his estranged wife would substantiate her allegations. She has asked a judge to make those records public, arguing they should never have been sealed in the first place.\nAdvertisement\nWade filed for divorce from his wife, Joycelyn Wade, in November 2021, one day after his first contract with Willis’s office took effect. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Willis has been subpoenaed to testify in Wade’s divorce proceeding, according to a court filing. A lawyer for Joycelyn Wade didn’t immediately provide comment.\nAccording to Merchant’s motion, Wade billed the county for 24 hours of work on a single day in November 2021, shortly after getting the special prosecutor job.\nAndrew Fleischman, a criminal defense lawyer in Atlanta who frequently litigates against Willis’s office, called such a claim a red flag. “Most judges would be given serious pause by that number,” Fleischman said.\nMerchant’s filing also alleges that Willis improperly paid Wade from county forfeiture funds.\nThe Fulton County Courthouse.in Atlanta. PHOTO: KEVIN DIETSCH/GETTY IMAGES\nDanny Porter, the former longtime Republican District Attorney for Gwinnett County, a large suburban county northeast of Atlanta, said district attorneys in Georgia receive funds from various sources and “have almost absolute discretion as to how you spend it.” \nDistrict attorneys hire special prosecutors and consultants all the time, he said. “I can’t say that the expenditures on their face are improper,” he said. \nWade’s credentials have been questioned before. In 2020, a sheriff asked Wade’s law firm to review operations at a jail where several inmates had died.\nA local television station sued the sheriff and Wade that year, saying Wade was doing a bogus investigation and was unqualified for the role. The station said the probe was manufactured so that the sheriff would have pretext for denying a public records request, citing a pending investigation.\nWade denied any wrongdoing. A judge ordered the county to provide some documents to the television station, 11Alive, and the lawsuit was settled.\nPorter, the former district attorney for Gwinnett County, said that the alleged romantic relationship doesn’t inherently threaten the prosecution of the indictment. “The inappropriate relations stuff…it’s certainly not grounds to dismiss the case,” said Porter, who added that he knows Willis professionally.

         "U.S. He. Was. Hired to. Prosecute. Trump. Now. He's. Accused of an. Affair. With. Her. The district attorney brought. Nathan. Wade on to prosecute the former presidentbut he lacks experience trying felony cases, lawyers say ,. Jan. 10, 648 pm. ET 7 min. Fulton. County. District. Attorney. Fani. Willis and special prosecutor. Nathan. Wade. ATLANTAAllegations that. Fulton. County. District. Attorney. Fani. Willis engaged in an improper relationship with. Nathan. Wade, a special prosecutor on her team that brought racketeering charges against. Donald. Trump and others, are focusing attention on the. Atlanta attorney with little previous criminal trial experience. There exists no record that. Wade, a lawyer in private practice hired to lead the. Trump case, has ever handled a felony trial in. Georgia, according to a filing. Monday by a co-defendant in the. Trump case. The filing alleges that. Wade and. Willis have been in a continuing romantic relationship that predates her hiring him. While the filing didn't provide evidence of a romantic relationship, it makes a bombshell claim that. Willis hired her alleged boyfriend, and they both financially benefited from the arrangement. The motion. Monday stunned. Atlanta's tightknit legal community and injected uncertainty into one of the highest-profile prosecutions in the country. Lawyers in. Georgia say at a minimum, the allegations in the. Monday filing raise questions about why. Willis sought. Wade's services. \"My understanding is that he has no felony jury trial experience,\" said. Chris. Timmons, an. Atlanta defense lawyer who has prosecuted cases under the same racketeering law used against. Trump, known as a. RICO statute. Wade isn't qualified to serve as a court-appointed defense lawyer in the. Trump case, according to. Monday's motion. To pick up such an assignment, a lawyer needs to have tried \"at least two criminal trials of similar offenses,\" according to a document from the. Fulton. County. Superior. Court. Wade's lack of relevant experience \"would be concerning in any complex felony case, let alone one that is a multi-defendant. RICO case,\" said. Timmons, an. ABC. News contributor. Fulton. County special prosecutor. Nathan. Wade last year in court. A spokesman for. Willis didn't respond to a request for comment. Wednesday. Previously, the spokesman said. Willis's office would respond to the allegations in its own filing. Willis's office hadn't filed a response as of. Wednesday afternoon. Nathan. Wade didn't immediately respond to a request for comment left on the voicemail at his law office. Wade's two-person law firm,. Wade. Campbell, handles a range of legal matters from divorces to car accident disputes, according to. Wade's online bio. After graduating from. Atlanta's. John. Marshall. Law. School,. Wade worked briefly as an assistant solicitor for. Georgia's. Cobb. County in , prosecuting misdemeanor cases. He later became a municipal judge in the. Atlanta suburb of. Marietta, hearing misdemeanor cases and traffic offenses. Between and ,. Wade ran three timesunsuccessfullyfor a judgeship on the. Cobb. County. Superior. Court. Wade has been paid nearly 654,000 in legal fees by. Willis's office since. January , according to. Fulton. County financial records. The last payment to his firm shown in those records is from early. October; if. Wade continued to receive payments at a similar rate to the rest of the contract, he could have earned close to 1 million, according to the motion. Wade has frequently appeared in court in the. Trump case. At a. Dec. 1 hearing,. Wade responded to arguments by. Trump's lawyer that a trial in late would interfere with the election. \"The district attorney has made it clear that she has no interest in interfering or getting involved with this presidential election,\". Wade said. Former. President. Donald. Trump departing the. Fulton. County. Jail after turning himself into authorities on. Aug. 24, . Willis and. Wade have moved in the same legal circles for years, including overlapping terms as municipal court judges in the. Atlanta area. Monday's filing alleged. Willis awarded. Wade a taxpayer-funded salary he has used to pay for trips he took with. Willis to. Napa. Valley and the. Caribbean. Ashleigh. Merchant, the lawyer who researched and wrote the filing, said sealed records from. Wade's divorce proceeding from his estranged wife would substantiate her allegations. She has asked a judge to make those records public, arguing they should never have been sealed in the first place. Wade filed for divorce from his wife,. Joycelyn. Wade, in. November , one day after his first contract with. Willis's office took effect. The. Wall. Street. Journal reported. Tuesday that. Willis has been subpoenaed to testify in. Wade's divorce proceeding, according to a court filing. A lawyer for. Joycelyn. Wade didn't immediately provide comment. According to. Merchant's motion,. Wade billed the county for 24 hours of work on a single day in. November , shortly after getting the special prosecutor job. Andrew. Fleischman, a criminal defense lawyer in. Atlanta who frequently litigates against. Willis's office, called such a claim a red flag. \"Most judges would be given serious pause ,\". Fleischman said. Danny. Porter, the former longtime. Republican. District. Attorney for. Gwinnett. County, a large suburban county northeast of. Atlanta, said district attorneys in. Georgia receive funds from various sources and \"have almost absolute discretion as to how you spend it.\". District attorneys hire special prosecutors and consultants all the time, he said. \"I can't say that the expenditures on their face are improper,\" he said. Wade's credentials have been questioned before. In , a sheriff asked. Wade's law firm to review operations at a jail where several inmates had died. A local television station sued the sheriff and. Wade that year, saying. Wade was doing a bogus investigation and was unqualified for the role. The station said the probe was manufactured so that the sheriff would have pretext for denying a public records request, citing a pending investigation. Wade denied any wrongdoing. A judge ordered the county to provide some documents to the television station, 11Alive, and the lawsuit was settled. Porter, the former district attorney for. Gwinnett. County, said that the alleged romantic relationship doesn't inherently threaten the prosecution of the indictment. \"The inappropriate relations stuffit's certainly not grounds to dismiss the case,\" said. Porter, who added that he knows. Willis professionally. He said the allegations still may be awkward for. Willis. If. Willis were to recuse herself or be disqualified from the case, the rest of her office would likely be removed as well and it would have to be assigned to another district attorney, he said. It's possible, among myriad next steps including. Willis responding to the allegations, that the. Georgia. Bureau of. Investigation could investigate the claims, said. Scott. Key, an attorney in private practice who is a former president of the. Georgia. Association of. Criminal. Defense. Lawyers. The. Georgia. Bar. Association may eventually step in, but it is unlikely it would investigate on its own unless or until a formal complaint was made, he said. The motion filed. Willis and. Wade may themselves be open to racketeering charges on the alleged misuse of funds. \"Willis has proven herself that it doesn't take much to invoke a. RICO liability,\". Key said. James.

If either Ron DeSantis or Ms. Haley can emerge from Iowa with momentum going into New Hampshire, it’s possible one of them could give Mr. Trump a contest.

         "Advertisement\nOPINION\nREVIEW & OUTLOOK\nFollow\nDemocrats Squeeze Nonunion Car Makers\nThirty-three Senators demand unionization without fair elections.\nBy\nThe Editorial Board\nFollow\nJan. 10, 2024 6:43 pm ET\n447\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(3 min)\nAn employee works at the BMW manufacturing plant in Greer, S.C., Oct. 19, 2022. PHOTO: BOB STRONG/REUTERS\nThe goal of unionizing the auto industry is too important to be left up to the actual workers. That’s the message from 33 Senate Democrats, who sent a threatening letter last week to the heads of 13 nonunion car makers, including Tesla, Toyota, Honda and BMW.\nThe lawmakers want each of these companies to roll over for the United Auto Workers (UAW) by “pledging not to interfere in any organizing activities occurring at its plants through the implementation of neutrality agreements.” The signers, led by Michigan Sens. Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow, imply that federal subsidies might be at risk if the CEOs don’t agree to go along.\nNeutrality agreements lay out a welcome mat for union organizers. The terms can vary, but a company might forfeit the ability to criticize a union that’s trying to persuade its employees to join. Businesses can also renounce their right to a secret-ballot union election, letting organizers sign up workers in a public process known as card check. That means union skeptics could face intimidation.\nAdopting neutrality agreements can be a way for companies to flaunt their progressive bona fides, especially if the practical effects are likely to be limited.

         "REVIEW. OUTLOOK. Thirty-three. Senators demand unionization without fair elections. Jan. 10, 643 pm. ET 447 3 min. An employee works at the. BMW manufacturing plant in. Greer,. S.C.,. Oct. 19, . The goal of unionizing the auto industry is too important to be left up to the actual workers. That's the message from 33. Senate. Democrats, who sent a threatening letter last week to the heads of 13 nonunion car makers, including. Tesla,. Toyota,. Honda and. BMW. The lawmakers want each of these companies to roll over for the. United. Auto. Workers. UAW by \"pledging not to interfere in any organizing activities occurring at its plants through the implementation of neutrality agreements.\". The signers, led . Gary. Peters and. Debbie. Stabenow, imply that federal subsidies might be at risk if the. CEOs don't agree to go along. Neutrality agreements lay out a welcome mat for union organizers. The terms can vary, but a company might forfeit the ability to criticize a union that's trying to persuade its employees to join. Businesses can also renounce their right to a secret-ballot union election, letting organizers sign up workers in a public process known as card check. That means union skeptics could face intimidation. Adopting neutrality agreements can be a way for companies to flaunt their progressive bona fides, especially if the practical effects are likely to be limited. Microsoft consented to neutrality as part of its deal to acquire. Activision in. October. But welcoming unionization is riskier in labor-intensive fields. Amazon and. Starbucks have bucked pressure to sign, and car manufacturers face even higher stakes. Political leverage over the auto industry, though, comes in the form of federal money. \"For the electric vehicle transition to be a success,\" the. Democratic. Senators say, \"we must make sure it includes a just transition for workers.\". The. Energy. Department in. August set aside 12 billion in subsidies for unionized. EV shops, and the. Administration could put similar strings on other funds. The pressure on nonunion car makers has picked up as the industry shifts investment toward electric vehicles, with most production being set up in. Southern states with right-to-work laws that let individual workers choose whether to join a union. The. UAW used a six-week strike last year to force the. Detroit car makers to pay higher wages to battery workers, but no such contract governs other companies. States can play defense against the neutrality push.

         "Donald Trump might win next week’s Iowa caucuses, but could a strong No. 2 pick up some momentum?",
         "Advertisement\nOPINION\nCOMMENTARY\nFollow\nHaley and DeSantis Hunt for ‘Big Mo’\nDonald Trump might win next week’s Iowa caucuses, but could a strong No. 2 pick up some momentum?\nBy\nKyle Peterson\nFollow\nJan. 10, 2024 6:15 pm ET\n212\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(9 min)\nFormer United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley smiles at a Fox News town hall in Des Moines, Iowa, Jan. 8. PHOTO: CHARLIE NEIBERGALL/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nAnkeny, Iowa\nRon DeSantis is nearing the end of his third pep rally of the day, surrounded by roughly 150 fans in a dimly lit baseball-themed sports bar (try the Ty Cobb Salad), when he tells the story that sums up his presidential appeal. “We had a Category 5 hurricane hit in Southwest Florida,” he says. It washed out a bridge and a causeway, stranding thousands of islanders from their homes. The estimate to rebuild? Six months.\n“Now, these are not state bridges. I had no control over them,” Mr. DeSantis says. But his help was sought, and the governor demanded no bureaucracy and no red tape. “The first bridge, to Pine Island,” he recounts, “we were able to reopen it in three days.” In the pub, the Iowans cheer. “A lot of these politicians,” he adds, picking up force, “they’re lily-livered. They don’t want to ever do anything where they take a risk, because they don’t want to get blamed.”\nThen he slides into home plate. “Those islands probably would have died if they had to wait six months, so we got it done,” he says. “You can expect nothing less from me as president.”\nThat last line would have sounded more like a promise, and less like bravado, when Mr. DeSantis entered the 2024 race last year as a favorite. But on Monday the Iowa caucuses will officially begin the GOP’s nominating process, and all the surveys are predicting a big-league win for Donald Trump. The former president leads the RealClearPolitics polling average with 52% support, as Mr. DeSantis vies for a distant second, all but tied near 17% with Nikki Haley.\nMr. Trump would have the public believe that it’s all over except the voting. Yet there are signs that he and his advisers are worried about falling short of expectations, and any story that ends with the party choosing someone else probably has to start in Iowa. Is there a contingent of voters who are delighted to tell pollsters they want Mr. Trump but who won’t venture out on a cold caucus night? The temperature forecast for Monday includes a minus sign.\nA surprisingly strong second-place finisher, the theory goes, could vault out of Iowa with some velocity toward New Hampshire, which holds its primary on Jan. 23. As George H.W. Bush put it after winning Iowa: “What we will have is momentum. We will look forward to ‘Big Mo’ being on our side, as they say in athletics.” Forget for a moment that Bush said this in 1980, before being thumped by Ronald Reagan. The legend of Big Mo has given hope to generations of presidential laggards.\nOn the lookout for this cryptid, the candidates have been crisscrossing the snowy corn stubble, speaking in restaurants and women’s clubs to 100 or more voters at a time. Iowa’s median age is 39, middling for states, but the caucus crowd isn’t a random sample. When asked for her age—so sorry, the editors demand to know—one woman suggests: “You can say, ‘73, looks like 68.’ ” As the pump-up playlist in Cedar Falls turns to Twisted Sister, a white-haired man in a sweater vest shuffles up to a pack of reporters to ask if they know how to turn down the music. “For chrissake,” he growls, “we’re not 20.”\nOnce they take the stage, the contrast between Ms. Haley and Mr. DeSantis is the difference between poetry and prose. Ms. Haley gives a longer speech and often skips Q&A, while leaving plenty of time to take photos and say hello one on one. She knows how to deploy a self-deprecating joke or a pause after a heavy point. Twice at a winery in Indianola, someone in the audience sneezes, and Ms. Haley drops a “bless you” into the middle of her political arguments. “Every single time. It’s great,” a woman whispers to a friend, charmed by this small show of manners.\n“She’s a transformational leader. She’s not only empathetic, she’s got goals—goals that we need as a country,” says a Quad Cities supporter who has seen Ms. Haley three times. Or a similar testimonial: “She is not polarizing. She’s respectable. When she speaks, she doesn’t elevate herself by attacking others, particularly on a personal level.” At a Haley event it doesn’t take much effort to find a voter who claims to be a longtime Democrat. One of her applause lines is to cite a survey that shows her beating President Biden by 17 points.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis prepares to speak at a town hall in Des Moines, Iowa, Jan. 9. PHOTO: JIM LO SCALZO/SHUTTERSTOCK\n“What happens if you have a double-digit win, going into D.C.?” Ms. Haley asks. “That’s a mandate to stop this wasteful spending and get our economy back on track. That’s a mandate to get our kids reading again and get our education back to the basics. That’s a mandate to secure our border, with no more excuses. That’s a mandate to bring law and order back to our country. And that’s a mandate for a strong America that we can be proud of. Don’t y’all want that again?”\nMr. DeSantis’s campaign style is almost the inverse. He gives brief opening remarks but spends most of his stage time calling on voters and answering questions shouted from the throng. He doesn’t do dramatic pauses. The end of his stump speech is written as soaring rhetoric, with citations to the Founders and a line about how the best view from an airplane landing in Washington isn’t on the left side of the jetliner, looking down on the National Mall, but from a window on the right, facing Arlington Cemetery.\nHe blows through the whole set piece at 85 mph, barely breathing between sentences. It’s Gettysburg and Normandy, delivered with all the emotion of a waiter who knows the dinner specials by heart and has six other tables waving for attention. The flip side of this personality type, though, is that Mr. DeSantis actually seems to revel in the details of policy and exercising power.\nAdvertisement\nWhile Ms. Haley suggests the federal government somehow can “get our kids reading again,” Mr. DeSantis floats an ambitious proposal to take school choice national via a federal tax credit for corporate donations to private scholarships. This is a model with a history in his state. “We serviced 100,000 kids a year in Florida for $1 billion, between administrative costs and scholarship,” he says. If the feds “did $25 billion or, man, $50 billion, which is budget dust to these guys, you’re talking about millions of kids that could be liberated.”\nMr. DeSantis’s nuts-and-bolts approach doesn’t put off his supporters. “For me, what you do speaks so loudly, I cannot hear what you say,” one explains. In other words, look at his record. “Just utter competence,” another man says. “He’s the only one who is presidential material.” Some voters mention a Florida connection: They escaped to Mr. DeSantis’s state amid the pandemic or have family who moved there. The place works, they say. Imagine if America worked.\nA surprise, or perhaps not, is how much Ms. Haley and Mr. DeSantis agree, at least directionally. Both would like to shrink the federal government, cut spending, secure the border, build the wall, and ease restrictions on oil-and-gas drilling so the U.S. can be “energy dominant,” a phrase both have used. They both want term limits on Congress, as well as other far-reaching—and, frankly, far-fetched—structural reforms. Ms. Haley renews her call to subject elected officials over 75 to “mental competency tests.” Mr. DeSantis pitches a presidential line-item veto.\nOne place they diverge is Ukraine. Why should voters care about Vladimir Putin’s invasion? That’s “a legitimate question,” Ms. Haley says, but for her it isn’t a rhetorical one. She fears Mr. Putin’s appetites won’t be satisfied, and a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally might be next: “This is about preventing war. This has always been about preventing war.” As Mr. Putin rearms his forces with “drones from Iran, missiles from North Korea,” Ms. Haley argues that the U.S. equipment and ammo sent to Ukraine’s defenders is “only 3.5% of our defense budget—that’s it.”\nHer rival is nearer to Mr. Trump’s view. “Obviously Biden has no clue as to kind of how this is all going to end, and so I think they’ve really been funding a stalemate there,” Mr. DeSantis says. “A president that’s responsible, I think, would find a way to bring this to a conclusion, because I don’t think it’s in our interests to just be doing $100 billion a year indefinitely. For what?”\nMr. DeSantis has a strong on-the-ground organization in Iowa, and he has visited all 99 counties. But he hasn’t gained in the polls. Voters who want to waylay the front-runner, Mr. Trump, might worry at this point that Mr. DeSantis is too far behind to catch up. He has fallen to 6% in the New Hampshire average. Momentum can carry only so far.\nMs. Haley, on the other hand, is a solid second in New Hampshire, with 29% to Mr. Trump’s 43%. Also notable is that 12% of “Live Free or Die” primary voters had been backing the most anti-Trump candidate around, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who dropped out Wednesday. There are plenty of ifs, but could this be the year to prove Big Mo is no rumor? If Ms. Haley surges in Iowa, and if she starts to look like a real threat to Mr. Trump, and if this attracts Mr. Christie’s base, and if it carries forward to South Carolina . . .\nMr. Peterson is a member of the Journal’s editorial board.\nWonder Land: Surveying the record of his three years in office, Mr. Biden has decided his re-election turns on two events: the Capitol riot of 2021 and Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse the 2020 presidential election results in several states.

U.S. can be \"energy dominant,\" a phrase both have used. They both want term limits on. Congress, as well as other far-reachingand, frankly, far-fetchedstructural renews her call to subject elected officials over 75 to \"mental competency tests.\". Mr. DeSantis pitches a presidential line-item veto. One place they diverge is. Ukraine. Why should voters care about. Vladimir. Putin's invasion? That's \"a legitimate question,\". Ms. Haley says, but for her it isn't a rhetorical one. She fears. Mr. Putin's appetites won't be satisfied, and a. North. Atlantic. Treaty. Organization ally might be next \"This is about preventing war. This has always been about preventing war.\". As. Mr. Putin rearms his forces with \"drones from. Iran, missiles from. North. Korea,\". Ms. Haley argues that the. U.S. equipment and ammo sent to. Ukraine's defenders is \"only 3.5 of our defense budgetthat's it.\". Her rival is nearer to. Mr. Trump's view. \"Obviously. Biden has no clue as to kind of how this is all going to end, and so. I think they've really been funding a stalemate there,\". Mr. DeSantis says. \"A president that's responsible,. I think, would find a way to bring this to a conclusion, because. I don't think it's in our interests to just be doing 100 billion a year indefinitely. For what?\". Mr. DeSantis has a strong on-the-ground organization in. Iowa, and he has visited all 99 counties. But he hasn't gained in the polls. Voters who want to waylay the front-runner,. Mr. Trump, might worry at this point that. Mr. DeSantis is too far behind to catch up. He has fallen to 6 in the. New. Hampshire average. Momentum can carry only so far. Ms. Haley, on the other hand, is a solid second in. New. Hampshire, with 29 to. Mr. Trump's 43. Also notable is that 12 of \"Live. Free or.

         "Advertisement\nOPINION\nCOMMENTARY\nFollow\nReports of DEI’s Death Are Greatly Exaggerated\nSo long as the implicit-association test is in circulation, the myth of a mostly racist U.S. will live.\nBy Hal R. Arkes\nJan. 10, 2024 6:14 pm ET\n585\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(6 min)\nPHOTO: GETTY IMAGES\nDEI is down but not out. Several states, universities and corporations signaled their retreat from diversity, equity and inclusion programs last year. Yet despite these developments, the movement remains alive and well thanks in part to the implicit-association test: a popular tool that has been used to claim that most of the U.S. is racially prejudiced.\nThree scholars first introduced the concept in a 1998 article in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology titled, “Measuring Individual Differences in Implicit Cognition: The Implicit Association Test.” The article describes how researchers measured how quickly respondents associated “good” and “bad” words with white or black faces. When people more quickly paired good words with “white” and bad words with “black,” they were deemed implicitly biased.\nIn a 2007 article in the European Review of Social Psychology, another group of academics found that approximately 68% of whites manifested a biased result. This quickly morphed into the widespread assertion, in some of the press, that 68% of whites are racially prejudiced.\nThe test has since become a fixture in DEI training programs nationwide, with universities and businesses often using it during mandatory training sessions for students and employees. Harvard University’s Project Implicit reports that more than 20 million people have taken its online administration of the test on various topics, including implicit racial bias.\nThe tool, it turns out, is highly suspect. To see why, we must examine it with the two most important measures used for any other psychological test: reliability and validity.\nTest-retest reliability refers to the extent to which a person who takes the test twice obtains the same result. If a test taker’s scores on two repeated administrations of the same test are totally unrelated, its reliability would be zero. If the two scores were identical, its score would be 1. According to measurement scholars Jum Nunnally and Ira Bernstein, the threshold for acceptable test-retest reliability is 0.7. In 2015 one of the authors of the original 1998 article relayed that the reliability of the test is between 0.5 and 0.6, rendering it unreliable as a psychological test.\nThe next measure is validity, or whether the test measures what it’s supposed to measure. If you’re trying to analyze the factors that affect a baseball player’s salary, you would identify such metrics as his batting average, fielding errors, runs batted in, etc., and then compare them with the same statistics and salaries of his fellow players in a regression equation. Using this method in meta-analyses of the implicit-association test, several scholars have found that “implicit bias” accounts for between 2% and 5.6% of prejudicial behavior. Even Mahzarin Banaji and Anthony Greenwald, two of the test’s most prominent advocates, have written that “attempts to diagnostically use such measures risk undesirably high rates of erroneous classifications.” The test, in other words, is an extremely feeble predictor of behavior.\nConsider these problems in another context. Suppose someone invented a guilt detector to replace the jury system in American courtrooms. Defendants would be administered the test, and those deemed guilty would be sent to prison.\nSay the detector deemed 68% of people to be guilty, but the tool’s reliability was a mere 0.5 or 0.6 and it identified only 2% to 5.5% of the reasons someone may be guilty. America’s jails would be jam-packed with innocent people. So it is with the implicit-association test, which falsely classifies huge numbers of white Americans as bigots.\nDespite the tool’s inadequacies, one group has benefited enormously from its popularity: the companies that perform antibias training. In 2018 I asked a “debiasing trainer” how she measures the success of her company’s training. She said it assesses knowledge about implicit bias before training and then again after it. But that isn’t useful. Trainees necessarily know much more about any topic after they’ve learned it. What matters is whether the training caused people to be less biased, which isn’t measured.\nI asked if there was any assessment of whether the training helped group morale, hiring practices, and personal interactions. She said no, because the training company doesn’t return to measure such factors.\nDoes it use a control group that receives no training or alternate training to ascertain if the test-based training is superior? “Of course not,” she said. “The company doesn’t want to pay for a no-training group.” With such techniques, it would be virtually impossible to provide a truly rigorous approach to measuring—much less fighting—actual bias.\nThough the implicit-training test says very little, governments, universities, companies and nonprofits continue to force it on countless people. It makes sense for those who stand to profit from it, but it’s ruinous for the health of our polity. So long as the test remains in circulation, the divisive and destructive DEI enterprise will be alive and well.\nMr. Arkes is an emeritus professor of psychology at Ohio State University.\nAdvertisement\nWonder Land: College Presidents' spineless response to antisemitic protests are the culmination of academia’s plummet the past 50 years which has included grade inflation, speech codes, trigger warnings and ultimately cancel culture.

A vote to hold him in contempt would set up a potential third criminal prosecution that could coincide with his father’s re-election campaign. \n“You are the epitome of white privilege coming into the Oversight committee, spitting in our face, ignoring a congressional subpoena to be deposed,” said Rep. Nancy Mace (R., S.C.). “What are you afraid of?”\n“Hunter Biden should be arrested right here, right now and go straight to jail,” she said.\nDemocrats pointed to public comments made in the past by Republican committee leaders saying that they would allow Hunter Biden to testify publicly in an open hearing—and dared Republicans to put him on the witness stand right then and there. \n“Who wants to hear from Hunter right now, today? Anyone? Come on. Who wants to hear from Hunter?” said Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D., Fla.), suggesting that the panel vote on the idea. “Nobody over there wants to hear from the witness.”\nWednesday’s proceedings stemmed from Hunter Biden’s decision not to comply with subpoenas that the House Judiciary and the House Oversight and Accountability committees issued late last year. Members of the two panels voted along party lines Wednesday evening to recommend holding Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress, sending the matter to the full House. The votes came after each panel held hours of simultaneous hearings in different rooms on his failure to appear for a deposition in a congressional impeachment probe into whether President Biden benefited from his family’s business dealings. \nHunter Biden attending a House Oversight Committee meeting on Wednesday.

The younger Biden offered to testify but insisted on doing so publicly out of concern about selective leaks of his testimony. House Republicans said he couldn’t dictate the terms of his appearance and needed to first answer questions privately.\nSenior White House staff and Biden allies are uncomfortable that Hunter Biden keeps putting himself in the spotlight and wish he would maintain a lower profile, according to people familiar with the situation. They see little upside in reminding voters of his antics, which involve failure to pay taxes on time and inappropriate behavior as he struggled with addiction to drugs and alcohol.\n“If you’re sitting in the White House right now, you’re like, ‘Please, Hunter Biden. We know your dad loves you. Please stop talking in public.’ This is not helpful to any of them for him to be out there,” said former Biden White House press secretary Jen Psaki in December, speaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press” shortly after Hunter Biden defied the subpoenas. “The White House would like him to probably go away right now.”\nBy appearing at the Oversight hearing Wednesday, Hunter Biden sought to highlight his willingness to cooperate with the panel’s inquiry on his own terms.\nPresident Biden is seeking a second term.

They stood up and left after less than an hour, as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.) was speaking. “Excuse me, Hunter, apparently you’re afraid of my words,” she said. Hunter Biden didn’t make an appearance at the simultaneous Judiciary Committee hearing on the same topic.\nLowell read a statement outside the Oversight committee room, accusing Republicans of using his client as a way to attack the president and repeating that his client has offered to work with the committee several times in the past, including an offer made Wednesday. Ignoring those efforts, Lowell said, shows “they cared little for the truth.” \nThe twin House proceedings Wednesday set Congress on a path that could add to Hunter Biden’s legal difficulties, though he might not be prosecuted even if he is held in contempt. The contempt-of-Congress charge carries a maximum sentence of a year in prison and a fine of up to $100,000. If the Republican-controlled House of Representatives approves the measures, the matter will be referred to the Justice Department. \nAdvertisement\nSeparately, Hunter Biden is due in court Thursday in Los Angeles for an initial appearance on tax charges related to failing to file returns on time and for allegedly claiming false deductions on some of the forms he did file. \nThe contempt-of-Congress resolution puts the president’s family drama in the spotlight as the 2024 presidential campaign gets fully under way. President Biden has pitched himself as an antidote to former President Donald Trump’s chaotic tenure in office. But his son’s actions have given Trump, the likely GOP nominee, ammunition to undermine that claim.\nFormer President Donald Trump campaigned in Iowa earlier this month.

Three of the 10 buyers of Biden’s art were Democratic donors and their purchases amounted to 70% of his proceeds, according to people familiar with the testimony. \nThe lion’s share was to Morris, the Hollywood lawyer who sat with Hunter Biden on Wednesday and has become personally close to him, the people said.\nHunter Biden has opted for a combative legal strategy on several fronts. In recent months, he has filed lawsuits against Rudy Giuliani and the Internal Revenue Service over alleged breaches of his privacy.\nIn July, the younger Biden was set to admit to failing to pay his taxes in 2017 and 2018, as part of a plea deal in which he would have avoided prosecution on a gun charge. But the deal dissolved during a hearing in which federal prosecutors and Biden’s legal team disagreed in open court about the immunity it granted the president’s son from potential additional charges.\nHunter Biden was later indicted on three felony gun charges related to a 2018 firearm purchase. In that case, he has sought to subpoena Trump and former Attorney General William Barr as he prepares to raise a defense that his prosecution on felony gun charges stems from an “unrelenting pressure campaign” by the former president and his Republican allies.\nIn December, Hunter Biden was charged with nine tax offenses in an indictment that accused him of failing to pay his taxes on time between 2016 and 2019 and claiming false deductions for various personal expenses, including membership to a sex club, pornography and his daughter’s law-school tuition.\nIf the House votes to hold Hunter Biden in contempt, he would be referred to the Justice Department for prosecution. Such a referral would put the Justice Department in the fraught position of determining whether to pursue another criminal case against the president’s son. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.\nA White House spokesman, Ian Sams, said the contempt resolution and a separate hearing Wednesday, which is part of a GOP effort to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, represent “baseless attacks” on Biden’s White House and family. \nDemocrats used the Oversight hearing to raise questions about the legitimacy of the underlying impeachment probe into President Biden, noting that after a year investigating, the committee has yielded nothing about the president that rises to the standard for removal from office.\nFormer Trump aide Steve Bannon was found guilty in 2022 and later sentenced to four months in prison. PHOTO: KEVIN LAMARQUE/REUTERS\n“We were here for a year [and] you did not lay a glove on Joe Biden,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), the top Democrat on the panel. “Why are we here? We can’t go after Joe Biden, he’s clean. Let’s go after Hunter Biden.”\nRepublicans noted that there is nothing unusual about their investigative process, which is to bring in witnesses for closed-door interviews before holding subsequent public hearings. Indeed, Raskin used this playbook for a probe he was part of during the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and was insistent that witnesses followed the subpoenas.\n“Please tell your children out there in America, if you get a subpoena to go before Congress, if you get a subpoena to go to the court, go,” Raskin said on MSNBC in July 2022 as a former Trump aide was defying a subpoena.\nIn past administrations, both Democratic and Republican, the Justice Department has often declined to pursue contempt-of-Congress cases. But in most of those cases, the Justice Department considered whether to prosecute government officials who asserted executive privilege in refusing to appear for questioning or turn over documents to Congress, legal experts said.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat lies ahead for Hunter Biden? Join the conversation below.\nFollowing referrals from Congress, the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington brought contempt charges in recent years against former Trump aides Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro in connection with their defiance of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\nCongress also voted, largely on party lines, to hold former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and Dan Scavino, the deputy chief of staff for communications in the Trump White House, in contempt of Congress on similar grounds.

Expectations of U.S. regulatory approval for such funds drove the price of bitcoin to the highest level in about two years. The digital currency traded just below $46,000 late Wednesday, up from $17,000 in January 2023.\nUntil now, everyday investors who wanted to buy and sell digital currencies have had to either trade on crypto exchanges and incur hefty transaction fees or purchase products that track bitcoin in less direct ways. At least half a dozen bitcoin-futures ETFs are already on the market. Those funds use futures contracts to provide exposure to bitcoin price moves, though they have been criticized for often straying from bitcoin’s price. \nAll 11 applications filed by asset managers including BlackRock BLK -2.19%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\n, Fidelity Investments, ARK Investment Management, Invesco, WisdomTree WT -2.29%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\n, Bitwise Asset Management, Valkyrie and Grayscale Investments have been greenlighted to list. The new funds, known as spot-bitcoin ETFs because they buy and sell the digital currency itself, are expected to begin trading on Thursday.\n“Today is a monumental day in the history of digital assets,” Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at bitcoin ETF issuer Hashdex, said in a statement.\nCrypto assets were mixed after the SEC’s decision. Ether, the second largest digital currency rose nearly 10%. Coinbase Global COIN -7.77%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\n, the largest publicly traded crypto exchange whose stock price tends to move in tandem with bitcoin, fell 1.4% in after-hours trading. Coinbase is listed as the custodian on eight of the 11 spot-bitcoin ETF applications.\nThe SEC previously rejected applications for so-called spot bitcoin ETFs on the grounds that the underlying market is vulnerable to fraud and market manipulation. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said more regulation and investor protection is needed before a swath of investors get access to the crypto market.\nGensler acknowledged the latest ETF applications were similar to ones the SEC had denied in the past. But he said a court ruling last year in favor of crypto asset manager Grayscale had compelled the change.\n“Based on these circumstances and those discussed more fully in the approval order, I feel the most sustainable path forward is to approve the listing and trading of these spot bitcoin ETP shares,” he said.\nHe added the SEC “did not approve or endorse bitcoin.”\n“Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,” Gensler said.\nThe argument that the bitcoin market is rife with fraud and easily manipulated got a boost Tuesday when the SEC’s official X account was hacked.\nThe SEC order Wednesday noted that all the exchanges seeking to list bitcoin ETFs had a surveillance-sharing agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where bitcoin futures are listed. That agreement “can be reasonably expected to assist in surveilling for fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,” the order said. It cited the high correlation between bitcoin-futures prices and the price of bitcoin itself.\nTwo of the SEC’s five commissioners, Democrats Caroline Crenshaw and Jaime Lizarraga, voted against the decision. Crenshaw called the move “unsound and ahistorical,” saying it puts the agency “on a wayward path that could further sacrifice investor protection.”\nThe SEC’s two Republican commissioners, Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, joined Gensler in voting to approve the ETFs.\n“Today marks the end of an unnecessary but consequential saga,” Peirce said. She said the SEC’s previous rejections used perplexing logic and drove individual investors to less-efficient ways of gaining exposure to bitcoin.\nAdvertisement\nThe approval order, posted on the SEC’s website Wednesday, detailed how the agency has reversed its thinking about the risk of market manipulation in bitcoin in response to the August court decision.\nEXPLORE BUY SIDE FROM WSJ\nBuy Side is independent of The Wall Street Journal newsroom.\nBest Bitcoin ETFs\nBest Stock Trading Platforms\nWhat Is Portfolio Diversification\nAfter losing the Grayscale lawsuit, the SEC said, it studied the correlation between the spot-bitcoin market and the CME bitcoin futures market. Grayscale had claimed that the two markets were closely correlated, and the judges sided with the crypto asset manager in their decision. The SEC said after the new analysis, it is able to conclude that fraud or manipulation that impacts prices in spot-bitcoin markets would likely similarly affect CME bitcoin futures prices.\nThe unauthorized X post Tuesday claimed that the agency had approved these funds. Bitcoin initially jumped and then reversed its gains when the agency later posted that its account was compromised. The SEC said Wednesday that the agency’s Office of the Inspector General and the Federal Bureau of Investigations are now probing the incident.\nGensler has previously taken to X to say that investments in crypto assets can be “exceptionally risky and are often volatile.” Several crypto firms have filed for bankruptcy, and fraudsters continue to exploit the rising popularity of crypto assets to lure individual investors into scams, he had said.\nDespite such risks, many mainstream investors have flocked to crypto assets in recent years, sending prices soaring during the pandemic. In 2022, though, the collapse of several high-profile crypto exchanges caused prices to crash, wiping out $2 trillion in cryptocurrency value. The sector’s implosion culminated with the failure of FTX, the exchange ran by now-convicted crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried.\nThe likelihood of a spot bitcoin ETF being sold to the public appeared low until BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager with a near-perfect record of ETF approvals, threw its hat into the ring in June 2023.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWould you invest in spot bitcoin ETFs? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\nThe new bitcoin funds are expected to face intense competition in a crowded market. Some asset managers have chosen to compete on cost, while others have begun a marketing push. Fees for some of the funds will range from as low as zero in the first six months to as high as 1.5% of assets.\nThe fund approvals could potentially pave the way for some financial advisers to recommend that clients allocate funds to bitcoin. It is far easier for an adviser to recommend an ETF than bitcoin itself, which could require clearing a number of regulatory hurdles.\nBitcoin skeptics said the approval of spot-bitcoin ETFs could set a dangerous precedent for other crypto-asset ETFs to come to market in the future and make it more difficult for the SEC to protect investors. Several asset managers, including BlackRock, ARK, VanEck and Grayscale, have filed applications to launch the first ETFs that track the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether. The SEC faces a final deadline this May to approve or reject some of those funds.\n“This is going to open the floodgates for every type of crypto token and scam you can think of that’s going to be trying to get SEC approval.” said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a group that advocates for tighter financial regulations.\nPubKey, a bitcoin-themed bar in New York, posted a photo on X saying that it would be having an ETF party. “There’s always room in the rocket,” the bar wrote. Hashdex, one of the bitcoin ETF issuers, was poised to hold an event at PubKey on Wednesday evening.\nAlexander Osipovich and Dave Michaels contributed to this article.\nWrite to Vicky Ge Huang at vicky.huang@wsj.com and Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com\nThe Latest on Crypto\nCoverage of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, selected by the editors\nGET WSJ'S MARKETS A.M.

The new funds, known as spot-bitcoin. ETFs because they buy and sell the digital currency itself, are expected to begin trading on. Thursday. \"Today is a monumental day in the history of digital assets,\". Samir. Kerbage, chief investment officer at bitcoin. ETF issuer. Hashdex, said in a statement. Crypto assets were mixed after the. SEC's decision. Ether, the second largest digital currency rose nearly 10. Coinbase. Global. COIN -7.77 decrease; red down pointing triangle , the largest publicly traded crypto exchange whose stock price tends to move in tandem with bitcoin, fell 1.4 in after-hours trading. Coinbase is listed as the custodian on eight of the 11 spot-bitcoin. ETF applications. The. SEC previously rejected applications for so-called spot bitcoin. ETFs on the grounds that the underlying market is vulnerable to fraud and market manipulation. SEC. Chair. Gary. Gensler has said more regulation and investor protection is needed before a swath of investors get access to the crypto market. Gensler acknowledged the latest. ETF applications were similar to ones the. SEC had denied in the past. But he said a court ruling last year in favor of crypto asset manager. Grayscale had compelled the change. \"Based on these circumstances and those discussed more fully in the approval order,. I feel the most sustainable path forward is to approve the listing and trading of these spot bitcoin. ETP shares,\" he said. He added the. SEC \"did not approve or endorse bitcoin.\" \"Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,\". Gensler said. The argument that the bitcoin market is rife with fraud and easily manipulated got a boost. Tuesday when the. SEC's official. X account was hacked. The. SEC order. Wednesday noted that all the exchanges seeking to list bitcoin. ETFs had a surveillance-sharing agreement with the. Chicago. Mercantile. Exchange, where bitcoin futures are listed. That agreement \"can be reasonably expected to assist in surveilling for fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,\" the order said. It cited the high correlation between bitcoin-futures prices and the price of bitcoin itself. Two of the. SEC's five commissioners,. Democrats. Caroline. Crenshaw and. Jaime. Lizarraga, voted against the decision. Crenshaw called the move \"unsound and ahistorical,\" saying it puts the agency \"on a wayward path that could further sacrifice investor protection.\". The. SEC's two. Republican commissioners,. Hester. Peirce and. Mark. Uyeda, joined. Gensler in voting to approve the. ETFs. \"Today marks the end of an unnecessary but consequential saga,\". Peirce said. She said the. SEC's previous rejections used perplexing logic and drove individual investors to less-efficient ways of gaining exposure to bitcoin. The approval order, posted on the. SEC's website. Wednesday, detailed how the agency has reversed its thinking about the risk of market manipulation in bitcoin in response to the. August court decision. Buy. Side is independent of. The. Wall. Street. Journal newsroom. After losing the. Grayscale lawsuit, the. SEC said, it studied the correlation between the spot-bitcoin market and the. CME bitcoin futures market. Grayscale had claimed that the two markets were closely correlated, and the judges sided with the crypto asset manager in their decision. The. SEC said after the new analysis, it is able to conclude that fraud or manipulation that impacts prices in spot-bitcoin markets would likely similarly affect. CME bitcoin futures prices. The unauthorized. X post. Tuesday claimed that the agency had approved these funds. Bitcoin initially jumped and then reversed its gains when the agency later posted that its account was compromised. The. SEC said. Wednesday that the agency's. Office of the. Inspector. General and the. Federal. Bureau of. Investigations are now probing the incident. Gensler has previously taken to. X to say that investments in crypto assets can be \"exceptionally risky and are often volatile.\". Several crypto firms have filed for bankruptcy, and fraudsters continue to exploit the rising popularity of crypto assets to lure individual investors into scams, he had said. Despite such risks, many mainstream investors have flocked to crypto assets in recent years, sending prices soaring during the pandemic. In , though, the collapse of several high-profile crypto exchanges caused prices to crash, wiping out 2 trillion in cryptocurrency value. The sector's implosion culminated with the failure of. FTX, the exchange ran by now-convicted crypto entrepreneur. Sam. Bankman-Fried. The likelihood of a spot bitcoin. ETF being sold to the public appeared low until. BlackRock, the world's largest money manager with a near-perfect record of. ETF approvals, threw its hat into the ring in. June . Would you invest in spot bitcoin. ETFs? Why or why not? Join the conversation below. The new bitcoin funds are expected to face intense competition in a crowded market. Some asset managers have chosen to compete on cost, while others have begun a marketing push. Fees for some of the funds will range from as low as zero in the first six months to as high as 1.5 of assets. The fund approvals could potentially pave the way for some financial advisers to recommend that clients allocate funds to bitcoin. It is far easier for an adviser to recommend an. ETF than bitcoin itself, which could require clearing a number of regulatory hurdles. Bitcoin skeptics said the approval of spot-bitcoin. ETFs could set a dangerous precedent for other crypto-asset. ETFs to come to market in the future and make it more difficult for the. SEC to protect investors. Several asset managers, including. BlackRock,. ARK,. VanEck and. Grayscale, have filed applications to launch the first. ETFs that track the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether. The. SEC faces a final deadline this. May to approve or reject some of those funds. \"This is going to open the floodgates for every type of crypto token and scam you can think of that's going to be trying to get. SEC approval.\" said. Dennis. Kelleher, president of. Better. Markets, a group that advocates for tighter financial regulations. PubKey, a bitcoin-themed bar in. New. York, posted a photo on. X saying that it would be having an. ETF party. \"There's always room in the rocket,\" the bar wrote. Hashdex, one of the bitcoin. ETF issuers, was poised to hold an event at. PubKey on. Wednesday evening. No. More. Mr. Nice. Guy. In. Fighting. Trump,. Canada. Presents 'Mr. Elbows.'. Want to. Double. Your. Exposure to the. Trump. Meme. Coin? There's an. ETF in the. Works for. That.",

         "Some Jitterbug phone users have been unable to make calls for days",
         "Title: Best Buy-Owned Phone Service Faces Angry Customers After 3G Network Shutdown\n\nAdvertisement\nBUSINESS\nTELECOM\nBest Buy-Owned Phone Service Faces Angry Customers After 3G Network Shutdown\nSome Jitterbug phone users have been unable to make calls for days\nBy\nWill Feuer\nFollow\nand\nThomas Gryta\nFollow\nJan. 10, 2023 10:45 am ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(6 min)\nBest Buy owns Lively, which sells easy-to-use cellphones and has said it would provide an update about service issues on Thursday. PHOTO: RACHEL WISNIEWSKI FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nWhen Teresa Kurtz’s 78-year-old mother accidentally locked herself out of her home last week in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, she pulled out her Jitterbug flip phone to seek help, only to discover no calls would go through. \n“This was one little instance where it’s like, oh my gosh, this is her lifeline,” said Ms. Kurtz, 60, about her mother, who lives alone and faced chilly temperatures before receiving help from a neighbor.\nMs. Kurtz’s mother is among users of the Best Buy Co.-owned BBY -0.72%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\nLively service, which sells easy-to-use cellphones and medical-alert devices to mostly older people. The company’s Jitterbug Flip phone stopped working for some customers after the start of the new year following the planned shutdown of Verizon Communications Inc.’s VZ 2.02%\nincrease; green up pointing triangle\n3G network on Dec. 31.\n“As a result of network updates made on Jan. 2, some customers with a Jitterbug Flip phone are experiencing a disruption to their service,” Best Buy BBY -0.72%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\nsaid. The company said it is working to resolve the issue and noted that Jitterbug Flip2 phones, Jitterbug smartphones and Lively-branded devices aren’t impacted. \nIn a message to affected customers, Lively said it expects to provide an update by Thursday. It didn’t give an estimate of when service would be restored or how many customers had issues with their devices. Lively told those customers to use a different device to contact 911 in the case of an emergency.\n“Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our customers, and as soon as we learned about the issue, we worked to notify customers that were potentially impacted,” Best Buy said. \nAfter discovering service problems, Ms. Kurtz said she and her mother thought there was an issue with the phone battery or the bill not being paid. After a few days, she said she called Lively and got a recorded message about the Jitterbug phone issue. She ordered a new phone for her mother and is switching her to another wireless provider, she said. \nFamily members of Lively customers said the company has offered new phones free in some instances, or discounts on purchasing upgraded devices. \nLast year, all three major U.S. cellular carriers shut down their older 3G networks to free up more wireless spectrum for the build-out of 5G. The majority of U.S. cellphone users have access to 4G or 5G networks, though some older models continued to depend on 3G right up until carriers shut down those networks. Apple Inc.’s iPhone 4S, released more than a decade ago, was the last one the company produced that solely connected on 3G or older networks.\nBest Buy acquired Lively, formerly named GreatCall, in 2018 for $800 million in cash. The service at that time had 900,000 paying subscribers and offered “easy-to-use mobile products and connected devices tailored for aging consumers.” \nLively is known as a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, which buys wholesale access to a wireless network instead of owning and operating it. For major wireless carriers, such arrangements let them sell excess capacity on their networks and gain customers without having to bear the costs of marketing to them or signing them up.\nCarriers generally don’t discuss wholesale agreements or even acknowledge which services run on their networks. Lively’s marketing materials say it is powered by “the nation’s most reliable wireless network,” language that Verizon used in its own wireless marketing for years. \nVerizon initially planned to shut down its 3G network in 2019 but extended the deadline until just before the calendar turned to 2023, months after rivals closed similar systems. Some trade groups petitioned carriers to delay network shutdowns amid concerns of impacts for certain equipment such as security and medical alert systems and phone service for Americans. \nThe extension was “an effort to minimize potential service disruptions and provide additional time for our customers to transition to newer and more advanced technologies and devices,” a Verizon spokesman said. “We’ve had no significant network issues related to this transition and shutdown.”\nA spokesman for the Federal Communications Commission declined to comment on the Lively situation. The FCC has issued consumer warnings about the 3G shutdown and advised users to contact their mobile carrier ahead of time to determine whether service could be impacted.\nSome Jitterbug users were unaware of any coming changes to service related to 3G network shutdowns, according to their family members.\nDena Bisnette of Newton, Kan., said she had heard last year about the shutdown of the 3G network, and called Lively to ask if it would affect her Jitterbug flip phone. A company representative told her the flip phone could be reprogrammed for 4G, she said, but her phone stopped working last week. Ms. Bisnette said she ordered an upgraded Jitterbug Flip2 phone.\nFor 96-year-old Marjorie Rees, her Jitterbug flip phone is how she reaches loved ones from her retirement community, which doesn’t provide landline service for residents, one of her family members said.\n“I’m really at wits end, her phone just goes directly to voice mail when you call,” said her son Christopher Rees, 58, of Fredericksburg, Texas.

         "Best. Buy-Owned. Phone. Service. Faces. Angry. Customers. After 3G. Network. Shutdown. Jan. 10, 1045 am. ET 6 min. Best. Buy owns. Lively, which sells easy-to-use cellphones and has said it would provide an update about service issues on. Thursday. When. Teresa. Kurtz's 78-year-old mother accidentally locked herself out of her home last week in. Cedar. Rapids,. Iowa, she pulled out her. Jitterbug flip phone to seek help, only to discover no calls would go through. \"This was one little instance where it's like, oh my gosh, this is her lifeline,\" said. Ms. Kurtz, 60, about her mother, who lives alone and faced chilly temperatures before receiving help from a neighbor. Lively service, which sells easy-to-use cellphones and medical-alert devices to mostly older people. The company's. Jitterbug. Flip phone stopped working for some customers after the start of the new year following the planned shutdown of. Verizon. Communications. Inc.'s. VZ 2.02 increase; green up pointing triangle 3G network on. Dec. 31. \"As a result of network updates made on. Jan. 2, some customers with a. Jitterbug. Flip phone are experiencing a disruption to their service,\". Best. Buy. BBY -0.72 decrease; red down pointing triangle said. The company said it is working to resolve the issue and noted that. Jitterbug. Flip2 phones,. Jitterbug smartphones and. Lively-branded devices aren't impacted. In a message to affected customers,. Lively said it expects to provide an update by. Thursday. It didn't give an estimate of when service would be restored or how many customers had issues with their devices. Lively told those customers to use a different device to contact 911 in the case of an emergency. \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our customers, and as soon as we learned about the issue, we worked to notify customers that were potentially impacted,\". Best. Buy said. After discovering service problems,. Ms. Kurtz said she and her mother thought there was an issue with the phone battery or the bill not being paid. After a few days, she said she called. Lively and got a recorded message about the. Jitterbug phone issue. She ordered a new phone for her mother and is switching her to another wireless provider, she said. Family members of. Lively customers said the company has offered new phones free in some instances, or discounts on purchasing upgraded devices. Last year, all three major. U.S. cellular carriers shut down their older 3G networks to free up more wireless spectrum for the build-out of 5G. The majority of. U.S. cellphone users have access to 4G or 5G networks, though some older models continued to depend on 3G right up until carriers shut down those networks. Apple. Inc.'s iPhone 4S, released more than a decade ago, was the last one the company produced that solely connected on 3G or older networks. Best. Buy acquired. Lively, formerly named. GreatCall, in for 800 million in cash. The service at that time had 900,000 paying subscribers and offered \"easy-to-use mobile products and connected devices tailored for aging consumers.\". Lively is known as a mobile virtual network operator, or. MVNO, which buys wholesale access to a wireless network instead of owning and operating it. For major wireless carriers, such arrangements let them sell excess capacity on their networks and gain customers without having to bear the costs of marketing to them or signing them up. Carriers generally don't discuss wholesale agreements or even acknowledge which services run on their networks. Lively's marketing materials say it is powered by \"the nation's most reliable wireless network,\" language that. Verizon used in its own wireless marketing for years. Verizon initially planned to shut down its 3G network in but extended the deadline until just before the calendar turned to , months after rivals closed similar systems. Some trade groups petitioned carriers to delay network shutdowns amid concerns of impacts for certain equipment such as security and medical alert systems and phone service for. Americans. The extension was \"an effort to minimize potential service disruptions and provide additional time for our customers to transition to newer and more advanced technologies and devices,\" a. Verizon spokesman said. \"We've had no significant network issues related to this transition and shutdown.\". A spokesman for the. Federal. Communications. Commission declined to comment on the. Lively situation. The. FCC has issued consumer warnings about the 3G shutdown and advised users to contact their mobile carrier ahead of time to determine whether service could be impacted. Some. Jitterbug users were unaware of any coming changes to service related to 3G network shutdowns, according to their family members. Dena. Bisnette of. Newton,. Kan., said she had heard last year about the shutdown of the 3G network, and called. Lively to ask if it would affect her. Jitterbug flip phone. A company representative told her the flip phone could be reprogrammed for 4G, she said, but her phone stopped working last said she ordered an upgraded. Jitterbug. Flip2 phone. For 96-year-old. Marjorie. Rees, her. Jitterbug flip phone is how she reaches loved ones from her retirement community, which doesn't provide landline service for residents, one of her family members said. \"I'm really at wits end, her phone just goes directly to voice mail when you call,\" said her son. Christopher. Rees, 58, of. Fredericksburg,. Texas. He has tried. Lively customer service, but they gave him similar information that is posted on the website and no explanation of the problem or how to fix it. \"She is agitated and worried that she is going to miss a phone call,\" he said. \"For my mom's sake,.

If enacted, the proposed changes would provide qualifying borrowers with significantly more-generous options that could leave them debt-free sooner, while paying off only a fraction of their total loan balances. \nTo prevent student-debt balances from ballooning in the future, the administration plans to halve, to 5% from 10%, the amount of discretionary income borrowers must pay each month on their undergraduate loans if they are enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan. Borrowers with incomes below 225% of the federal poverty line wouldn’t have to make monthly payments on their loans. The administration estimated that that level corresponds to an individual income of less than roughly $30,600 annually or any borrower in a family of four who makes less than about $62,400 a year.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat do you think of the Biden Administration’s plan to overhaul income-driven repayment programs for student loans? Join the conversation below.\nBorrower loan balances won’t grow as long as they make their monthly payments, even if a low-income borrower’s monthly requirement is set at $0. The change would also forgive loan balances for people enrolled in income-based plans after 10 years of payments, down from 20 under many of the current options, for borrowers whose original loan balances were $12,000 or less.\n“We are, for the first time, creating a student-loan safety net in this country,” said Education Department Undersecretary James Kvaal.\nThe proposed rule now must go through a 30-day public-comment period, after which the department can release a final rule.\nBorrowers and members of both parties in Congress have criticized the existing income-driven repayment program as broken. A government watchdog report last year found that only 157 borrowers out of eight million enrolled in the program successfully had their debt forgiven after decades of payments. The program has existed since 1992.\nIn its regulatory notice, the administration acknowledged that the plan would lead to “increased costs of the student loan programs to the taxpayers in the form of transfers to borrowers who would pay less on their loans.” Some opponents of debt relief, including congressional Republicans, have criticized that arrangement as unfair to taxpayers who didn’t take out loans or who paid them off in full.\nPayment-plan changes could, over time, be nearly as costly as the mass debt-cancellation plan is projected to be. A University of Pennsylvania Wharton School model suggested a range of possible price tags for the changes to income-driven repayment ranging from around $70 billion over 10 years to $450 billion over a longer period, depending on enrollment, and whether colleges continue to raise costs. \nThe shortened repayment period for borrowers with less than $12,000 in debt could make some degree-granting programs, especially at community colleges, effectively free, according to some analysts. A Biden plan to provide free community college was nixed in spending talks with congressional Democrats. \nMany borrowers already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will be closer to debt forgiveness under changes announced by the Biden administration last year.

Borrowers who went into forbearance—a temporary payment freeze where interest continues to build up—for at least 36 months between July 2009 and March 2020 will receive at least three years of payment credit when payments resume later this year. \nThe Education Department said it would fix a longstanding problem where loan payments made to different servicers weren’t counted together, which can lead to undercounting of payments that qualify for eventual forgiveness. Those changes are likely to affect around 3.6 million borrowers, or nearly 10% of all holders of federal student loans.\nPayments and interest accrual on federal student loans have been frozen since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. They are now scheduled to resume 60 days after litigation over the loan-forgiveness program is resolved or the program is implemented.\nAdvertisement\nWrite to Gabriel T.

Attorney General Merrick Garland outlined the decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate. Photo: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\nWASHINGTON—Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday named Robert Hur, a former U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, as special counsel to examine why classified documents were found at President Biden’s home and office, intensifying scrutiny of Mr. Biden’s actions after he left the vice presidency in 2017.\nThe appointment came after Mr. Biden’s lawyer said aides found classified records, likely dating from Mr. Biden’s time as vice president, at his Wilmington, Del., garage and at an office he used at a Washington-based think tank that bears his name. It heightens political pressure on the White House and sets up the unusual prospect of three concurrent Justice Department special counsels, two of whom are investigating the actions of the president or his chief rival for office. Lawmakers from both parties in Congress have also demanded details on the discovery of the documents.\nAsk WSJ\nWhat's Next for the GOP?\nThe recent House speakership battle could reflect a larger conflict within the Republican party over its electoral and governing strategy moving forward. WSJ reporters discuss the future of the Republican Party and answer your questions.\nWatch the Conversation\n“I strongly believe that the normal processes of this department can handle all investigations with integrity. But under the regulations, the extraordinary circumstances here require the appointment of a special counsel for this matter,” Mr. Garland said, adding that he would ensure Mr. Hur got the resources he needed to conduct the probe. \nMr. Hur is a longtime federal prosecutor who was the U.S. attorney in Maryland during the Trump administration and a senior aide to the deputy attorney general. He clerked for the late U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist and prosecuted dozens of financial fraud, public corruption and other cases. He most recently was a defense lawyer in private practice. \nIn a brief order, Mr. Garland said Mr. Hur would examine the possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents found at Mr. Biden’s home and the think tank. “The Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,” the order said.    \n“I will conduct the assigned investigation with fair, impartial and dispassionate judgment,” Mr. Hur said in a statement, adding that he intended to “follow the facts swiftly and thoroughly without fear or favor.”\nMr. Hur’s work will be similar to that of another special counsel, Jack Smith, a longtime public-corruption and international prosecutor, who is running an investigation into former President Donald Trump’s potential mishandling of classified records and other matters. \nRobert Hur served as the U.S. attorney in Maryland in the Trump administration. PHOTO: CHIP SOMODEVILLA/GETTY IMAGES\n“We have cooperated closely with the Justice Department throughout its review, and we will continue that cooperation with the Special Counsel,” Mr. Biden’s lawyer, Richard Sauber, said in a statement Thursday, adding that the documents were “inadvertently misplaced.”\nThe appointment was the latest of several developments this week after the White House confirmed news reports that aides had found documents with classified markings at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, the president’s Washington-based think tank, on Nov. 2, and turned them over to the National Archives. The president’s team conducted a search for any further documents, which was completed on Wednesday, Mr. Sauber said.  \nThe National Archives’s inspector general notified a Justice Department prosecutor on Nov. 4 that documents with classified markings had been discovered at the center, where they weren’t authorized to be, Mr. Garland said, offering the fullest timeline yet of the discovery. The FBI on Nov. 9 began assessing whether classified material had been mishandled in violation of federal law, and on Nov. 14, Mr. Garland tasked the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Chicago, John Lausch, with reviewing the documents.\nFive weeks later, on Dec. 20, Mr. Biden’s lawyers told Mr. Lausch that additional documents with classified markings dating to Mr. Biden’s time in the Obama administration had been discovered in the garage of Mr. Biden’s home in Wilmington, prompting the FBI to go there and retrieve them.\nThursday morning, Mr. Biden’s lawyer told Mr. Lausch that an additional document bearing classification markings was identified at the president’s home in Wilmington.\nMr. Lausch on Jan. 5 told Mr. Garland he believed further investigation by a special counsel was warranted, but that he couldn’t do that task himself because he intended to leave the department.\nResponding to repeated questioning Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said officials didn’t disclose additional documents sooner because the search and the Justice Department’s process were still ongoing. She also wouldn’t say what sparked the initial search for documents, and reiterated that Mr. Biden didn’t know what was in them.\nAdvertisement\nThe appointment of Mr. Hur adds a third special counsel to the Garland era at the Justice Department, which he has tried to insulate from partisan influence, appointing outside prosecutors even as he has attested to the department’s vaunted independence from political pressure.\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said the extraordinary circumstances required the special counsel’s appointment. PHOTO: LEAH MILLIS/REUTERS\nJohn Durham, a former U.S. attorney in Connecticut, is continuing as special counsel to investigate the FBI’s handling of a 2016 inquiry into Russia’s interference in that year’s presidential election and any links to the Trump campaign. \nAt the same time, David Weiss, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware, is examining whether to bring a criminal case against Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, related to his tax dealings and a gun purchase. Mr. Weiss isn’t a special counsel but while other Trump U.S. attorneys left at the start of the administration, Mr. Garland kept Mr. Weiss on to similarly avoid the appearance of a conflict.\nWhile Mr. Garland and other senior Justice Department officials will be regularly briefed on the Biden documents investigation, any move to overrule a major decision by Mr. Hur would require them to notify Congress and explain their reasoning, per the special counsel regulations.\nAsked about the discovery of the latest batch of documents on Thursday, Mr. Biden said the documents had been in a locked garage with his Corvette sports car. “It’s not like they’re sitting out in the street,” he said. \nAfter reading language similar to his lawyer’s statement from the podium, the president said, “We’re going to see all this unfold,” adding, “I’m confident.”\nAsked if any countries had expressed concerns about the security of classified documents, John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said during a White House briefing Thursday: “I’m not aware of any such discussions or concerns.”\nRep. Mike Turner (R. Ohio), the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, asked the attorney general and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines to participate in a classified briefing on the matter. “The presence of classified information at these separate locations could implicate President Joe Biden in the mishandling, potential misuse, and exposure of classified information,” Mr. Turner said in a statement on Thursday. \nBefore Mr. Garland made his announcement, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) alleged Thursday morning that there was a double standard in how the federal government treated the Democratic president and Mr. Trump.\n“Treating law differently based on your political beliefs—that’s why we had to provide a new entity” to “look after the weaponization of what’s going on,” Mr. McCarthy said, referring to House Republicans’ creation of a new subcommittee to probe the Justice Department’s handling of sensitive investigations such as the one into Mr. Trump. \nMr. Trump has joined fellow Republicans in accusing Mr. Biden of hypocrisy on the issue.\nFBI agents found hundreds of classified and other government documents at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in August in boxes mixed in with clothing and news clippings. Mr. Trump’s lawyers had previously said they had turned such documents over to authorities.\n“It would not be surprising to learn that every single vice president and president since Eisenhower has left the West Wing with classified documents and didn’t even know it,” said Jay Town, a former U.S. attorney in the Trump administration. “We just have to have an understanding as to whether it was intentional or not, but it’s clear that this just happens to our executives. That reality needs to be built into any charging decision.”\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nPolitics\nGet email notifications about major political news, from campaigns to the Capitol.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nIt isn’t publicly known how much information is classified by the government, but watchdogs and open-government activists believe such a trove is likely to include billions of records—a sum that expands by millions more each year in part due to the ever-widening use of digital communications. \nRecently some Biden administration officials, including Ms. Haines, the director of national intelligence, have said overclassification is a national-security issue that hampers intelligence sharing among agencies and with partners, and contributes to public distrust in government. \nThe White House is currently working on an executive order, expected later this year, that is intended to overhaul aspects of the classification system, and the administration has released previously classified files about high-profile matters, including the John F. Kennedy assassination, Jamal Khashoggi’s murder and unidentified aerial phenomena, the last of which saw a new report published on Thursday. \nMr. Biden spends a significant amount of time at his two residences in Delaware. Before heading to the southern border and Mexico City, the president made a stop last weekend in Wilmington—his 60th trip to the state since taking office, according to former CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller, who tracks presidential data.

         "Appointment comes after classified documents were found at president's think tank and. Delaware home , 10 min 006. President. Biden said. Thursday a small number of classified documents from his time as vice president were found at his home and in his personal library. Attorney. General. Merrick. Garland outlined the decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate. WASHINGTONAttorney. General. Merrick. Garland on. Thursday named. Robert. Hur, a former. U.S. attorney during the. Trump administration, as special counsel to examine why classified documents were found at. President. Biden's home and office, intensifying scrutiny of. Mr. Biden's actions after he left the vice presidency in . The appointment came after. Mr. Biden's lawyer said aides found classified records, likely dating from. Mr. Biden's time as vice president, at his. Wilmington,. Del., garage and at an office he used at a. Washington-based think tank that bears his name. It heightens political pressure on the. White. House and sets up the unusual prospect of three concurrent. Justice. Department special counsels, two of whom are investigating the actions of the president or his chief rival for office. Lawmakers from both parties in. Congress have also demanded details on the discovery of the documents. What's. Next for the. GOP? The recent. House speakership battle could reflect a larger conflict within the. Republican party over its electoral and governing strategy moving forward. WSJ reporters discuss the future of the. Republican. Party and answer your questions. \"I strongly believe that the normal processes of this department can handle all investigations with integrity. But under the regulations, the extraordinary circumstances here require the appointment of a special counsel for this matter,\". Mr. Garland said, adding that he would ensure. Mr. Hur got the resources he needed to conduct the probe. Mr. Hur is a longtime federal prosecutor who was the. U.S. attorney in. Maryland during the. Trump administration and a senior aide to the deputy attorney general. He clerked for the late. U.S. Supreme. Court. Chief. Justice. William. Rehnquist and prosecuted dozens of financial fraud, public corruption and other cases. He most recently was a defense lawyer in private practice. In a brief order,. Mr. Garland said. Mr. Hur would examine the possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents found at. Mr. Biden's home and the think tank. \"The. Special. Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,\" the order said. \"I will conduct the assigned investigation with fair, impartial and dispassionate judgment,\". Mr. Hur said in a statement, adding that he intended to \" the facts swiftly and thoroughly without fear or favor.\". Mr. Hur's work will be similar to that of another special counsel,. Jack. Smith, a longtime public-corruption and international prosecutor, who is running an investigation into former. President. Donald. Trump's potential mishandling of classified records and other matters. Robert. Hur served as the. U.S. attorney in. Maryland in the. Trump administration. \"We have cooperated closely with the. Justice. Department throughout its review, and we will continue that cooperation with the. Special. Counsel,\". Mr. Biden's lawyer,. Richard. Sauber, said in a statement. Thursday, adding that the documents were \"inadvertently misplaced.\". The appointment was the latest of several developments this week after the. White. House confirmed news reports that aides had found documents with classified markings at the. Penn. Biden. Center for. Diplomacy and. Global. Engagement, the president's. Washington-based think tank, on. Nov. 2, and turned them over to the. National. Archives. The president's team conducted a search for any further documents, which was completed on. Wednesday,. Mr. Sauber said. The. National. Archives's inspector general notified a. Justice. Department prosecutor on. Nov. 4 that documents with classified markings had been discovered at the center, where they weren't authorized to be,. Mr. Garland said, offering the fullest timeline yet of the discovery. The. FBI on. Nov. 9 began assessing whether classified material had been mishandled in violation of federal law, and on. Nov. 14,. Mr. Garland tasked the. Trump-appointed. U.S. attorney in. Chicago,. John. Lausch, with reviewing the documents. Five weeks later, on. Dec. 20,. Mr. Biden's lawyers told. Mr. Lausch that additional documents with classified markings dating to. Mr. Biden's time in the. Obama administration had been discovered in the garage of. Mr. Biden's home in. Wilmington, prompting the. FBI to go there and retrieve them. Thursday morning,. Mr. Biden's lawyer told. Mr. Lausch that an additional document bearing classification markings was identified at the president's home in. Wilmington. Mr. Lausch on. Jan. 5 told. Mr. Garland he believed further investigation by a special counsel was warranted, but that he couldn't do that task himself because he intended to leave the department. Responding to repeated questioning. Thursday,. White. House press secretary. Karine. Jean-Pierre said officials didn't disclose additional documents sooner because the search and the. Justice. Department's process were still ongoing. She also wouldn't say what sparked the initial search for documents, and reiterated that. Mr. Biden didn't know what was in them. The appointment of. Mr. Hur adds a third special counsel to the. Garland era at the. Justice. Department, which he has tried to insulate from partisan influence, appointing outside prosecutors even as he has attested to the department's vaunted independence from political pressure. Attorney. General. Merrick. Garland said the extraordinary circumstances required the special counsel's appointment. John. Durham, a former. U.S. attorney in. Connecticut, is continuing as special counsel to investigate the. FBI's handling of a inquiry into. Russia's interference in that year's presidential election and any links to the. Trump campaign. At the same time,. David. Weiss, the. Trump-appointed. U.S. attorney in. Delaware, is examining whether to bring a criminal case against. Mr. Biden's son,. Hunter. Biden, related to his tax dealings and a gun isn't a special counsel but while other. Trump. U.S. attorneys left at the start of the administration,. Mr. Garland kept. Mr. Weiss on to similarly avoid the appearance of a conflict. While. Mr. Garland and other senior. Justice. Department officials will be regularly briefed on the. Biden documents investigation, any move to overrule a major decision by. Mr. Hur would require them to notify. Congress and explain their reasoning, per the special counsel regulations. Asked about the discovery of the latest batch of documents on. Thursday,. Mr. Biden said the documents had been in a locked garage with his. Corvette sports car. \"It's not like they're sitting out in the street,\" he said. After reading language similar to his lawyer's statement from the podium, the president said, \"We're going to see all this unfold,\" adding, \"I'm confident.\". Asked if any countries had expressed concerns about the security of classified documents,. John. Kirby, a spokesman for the. National. Security. Council, said during a. White. House briefing. Thursday \"I'm not aware of any such discussions or concerns.\". Rep. Mike. Turner. R. Ohio, the top. Republican on the. House. Intelligence. Committee, asked the attorney general and. Director of. National. Intelligence. Avril. Haines to participate in a classified briefing on the matter. \"The presence of classified information at these separate locations could implicate. President. Joe. Biden in the mishandling, potential misuse, and exposure of classified information,\". Mr. Turner said in a statement on. Thursday. Before. Mr. Garland made his announcement,. House. Speaker. Kevin. McCarthy. R.,. Calif. alleged. Thursday morning that there was a double standard in how the federal government treated the. Democratic president and. Mr. Trump. \"Treating law differently based on your political beliefsthat's why we had to provide a new entity\" to \"look after the weaponization of what's going on,\". Mr. McCarthy said, referring to. House. Republicans' creation of a new subcommittee to probe the. Justice. Department's handling of sensitive investigations such as the one into. Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has joined fellow. Republicans in accusing. Mr. Biden of hypocrisy on the issue. FBI agents found hundreds of classified and other government documents at. Mr. Trump's. Mar-a-Lago resort in. August in boxes mixed in with clothing and news 's lawyers had previously said they had turned such documents over to authorities. \"It would not be surprising to learn that every single vice president and president since. Eisenhower has left the. West. Wing with classified documents and didn't even know it,\" said. Jay. Town, a former. U.S. attorney in the. Trump administration. \"We just have to have an understanding as to whether it was intentional or not, but it's clear that this just happens to our executives. That reality needs to be built into any charging decision.\". NEWSLETTER. SIGN-UP. Get email notifications about major political news, from campaigns to the. Capitol. It isn't publicly known how much information is classified , but watchdogs and open-government activists believe such a trove is likely to include billions of recordsa sum that expands each year in part due to the ever-widening use of digital communications. Recently some. Biden administration officials, including. Ms. Haines, the director of national intelligence, have said overclassification is a national-security issue that hampers intelligence sharing among agencies and with partners, and contributes to public distrust in government. The. White. House is currently working on an executive order, expected later this year, that is intended to overhaul aspects of the classification system, and the administration has released previously classified files about high-profile matters, including the.

ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP/GETTY IMAGES\nBy\nKen Thomas\nFollow\nand\nSabrina Siddiqui\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 13, 2023 5:52 pm ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(8 min)\nWASHINGTON—President Biden’s departure from the White House in January 2017 involved a rush to pack up documents and other belongings, former aides said, as the then-vice president embarked on an intense stretch of domestic and international travel and a series of official events.\nDuring those final weeks, staff members were tasked with packing up Mr. Biden’s West Wing office, where he did much of his work, along with his larger office space at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building near the White House and his residence at the Naval Observatory.\nThat push to close down Mr. Biden’s eight years as vice president has come under intense scrutiny with the recent revelations that classified documents from that period were recently found at a Washington office used by Mr. Biden, and later inside a garage in his home in Wilmington, Del., according to a lawyer for the president. \nMuch remains unknown about how the documents came to be in those places or who put them there, and the White House has declined to provide detailed answers. But the revelations have raised concerns about Mr. Biden’s handling of the nation’s secrets and put the White House on the defensive over the manner in which they disclosed to the public the scope of the mishandled classified documents. \nThe White House said aides had found “a small number” of documents with classified markings at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, Mr. Biden’s post-vice presidential think tank, on Nov. 2, six days before the midterm elections, and turned them over to the National Archives. \nThe White House also said that on Dec. 20, Mr. Biden’s lawyers informed the Justice Department that additional documents with classified markings dating back to Mr. Biden’s time as vice president had been discovered in the garage of Mr. Biden’s home in Wilmington, near his 1967 Corvette Stingray. That prompted the FBI to retrieve the material. On Thursday morning, Mr. Biden’s lawyer informed the government that an additional document bearing classified markings was identified at the president’s home in Wilmington.\nOn Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland named Robert Hur, a former U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, as special counsel to examine the classified documents case.\nBiden ‘Cooperating Fully’ With DOJ as Garland Appoints Special Counsel\nPlay video: Biden ‘Cooperating Fully’ With DOJ as Garland Appoints Special Counsel\nPresident Biden said Thursday a “small number” of classified documents from his time as vice president were found at his home and in his personal library. Attorney General Merrick Garland outlined the decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate. Photo: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\nThe White House has said Mr. Biden didn’t know the documents had been stored in the two locations nor did he know what was in the documents. The president, during a news conference Tuesday that capped off a visit to Mexico, said he was surprised by the discovery and was cooperating on the matter. \nMr. Biden’s lawyer, Richard Sauber, has said the White House is confident that the Justice Department review “will show that these documents were inadvertently misplaced, and the president and his lawyers acted promptly upon discovery of this mistake.”\nRepublicans have accused the Justice Department of maintaining a double standard on the issue of retention of classified documents because it obtained a warrant to search the Florida home of former President Donald Trump over his holding of top secret documents as part of a criminal investigation. \nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWSJ Politics & Policy\nScoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nThe Justice Department has indicated that part of its investigation includes potential obstruction, after the issue was referred to prosecutors by the National Archives following months of negotiations with Mr. Trump’s lawyers. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and described the investigation as a witch hunt. \nSome of President Biden’s current advisers worked with him during his final days as vice president, including counselor Steve Ricchetti, who was Mr. Biden’s last vice presidential chief of staff, communications director Kate Bedingfield, who held the same position from 2015 to 2017, and chief speechwriter Vinay Reddy. The White House has referred questions about the documents to the Justice Department, which declined to comment.\nFormer aides said the vice president’s general counsel’s office oversaw the documents retention process. Mr. Biden’s executive assistant at the time, Kathy Chung, was most heavily involved in the packing up of the office, according to former aides, but was helped by other lower-level staff members.\nMs. Chung, who now serves as deputy director of protocol for Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, was interviewed by federal investigators late last year about the discovered documents, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Pentagon on Friday declined to make Ms. Chung available for comment and referred calls to the Justice Department, which declined to comment. \nThe Washington, D.C., office building that houses the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, Mr. Biden’s post-vice presidential think tank, where aides discovered ‘a small number’ of classified documents last year. PHOTO: JIM LO SCALZO/SHUTTERSTOCK\nFormer aides described a frenetic few weeks before Mr. Trump took office as Mr. Biden crisscrossed the nation and embarked on a final foreign trip to Ukraine and Switzerland shortly before the inauguration. That busy travel schedule created new documents and papers up until the final day and complicated the packing process, they said. With many senior staff members on the road with Mr. Biden, some aides described a depleted staff in Washington trying to clear the vice president’s offices as the transition of power loomed. \nSome members of Mr. Biden staff had already departed their roles, they said, and those who remained worked to maintain daily briefings and operations in a hectic final sprint while sorting through documents and belongings that were no longer needed.\nDuring his final two weeks, Mr. Biden presided over Congress for the counting of the electoral votes for the 2016 election, and then took a trip to California, where he appeared at a fundraiser for then Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and delivered a speech at a healthcare conference in San Francisco. After departing California, Mr. Biden attended an event in Chicago with outgoing President Barack Obama and then stopped in Detroit to visit the North American International Auto Show.\nAdvertisement\nDays later, Mr. Biden was surprised by Mr. Obama with the presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House, an event that brought together the then-vice president’s large extended family. \nMr. Biden then traveled to New York for an appearance on ABC’s “The View,” where he noted that he had personally written a classified memorandum for Vice President-elect Mike Pence. “He’ll call me and ask about, or I’ll call him about what’s going on in Ukraine, what’s going on here, what’s going on there,” Mr. Biden said at the time.\nThe capstone of his final days was a trip to Kyiv for a meeting with then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Among the classified documents discovered in the locales associated with Mr. Biden was a briefing paper related to Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nVice President Biden in Kyiv, Ukraine, with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, on one of Mr. Biden’s final days in office in January 2017. PHOTO: SERGII KHARCHENKO/NURPHOTO/GETTY IMAGES\nFrom there, Mr. Biden flew to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum, where he addressed the forum, quipping to the audience, “I’ll be vice president of the United States for 48 more hours.” The stop in Davos included a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Mr. Biden and his aides landed back at Joint Base Andrews on the evening of Jan. 18, with the inauguration a little more than a day away. \nWhile aboard Air Force Two, Mr. Biden spoke with the prime minister of Kosovo in an effort to defuse tensions with Serbia, and held separate conversations with the leaders of the Republic of Cyprus, Northern Cyprus and Greece to discuss settlement talks in the region. His final days in office also included a call with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi regarding the fight against ISIL, and a meeting with the prime minister of Ukraine during his stop in Kyiv.\nThe General Services Administration, a government agency, provides logistical support at the end of each administration.

         "Before. Biden. Left the. White. House as. Vice. President, a. Scramble to. Pack. Documents. A moving van at the. White. House in. Washington,. D.C., on. Jan. 20,. Inauguration. Day, . ANDREW. CABALLERO-REYNOLDSAFPGETTY. IMAGES 8 min. WASHINGTONPresident. Biden's departure from the. White. House in. January involved a rush to pack up documents and other belongings, former aides said, as the then-vice president embarked on an intense stretch of domestic and international travel and a series of official events. During those final weeks, staff members were tasked with packing up. Mr. Biden's. West. Wing office, where he did much of his work, along with his larger office space at the. Eisenhower. Executive. Office. Building near the. White. House and his residence at the. Naval. Observatory. That push to close down. Mr. Biden's eight years as vice president has come under intense scrutiny with the recent revelations that classified documents from that period were recently found at a. Washington office used by. Mr. Biden, and later inside a garage in his home in. Wilmington,. Del., according to a lawyer for the president. Much remains unknown about how the documents came to be in those places or who put them there, and the. White. House has declined to provide detailed answers. But the revelations have raised concerns about. Mr. Biden's handling of the nation's secrets and put the. White. House on the defensive over the manner in which they disclosed to the public the scope of the mishandled classified documents. The. White. House said aides had found \"a small number\" of documents with classified markings at the. Penn. Biden. Center for. Diplomacy and. Global. Engagement,. Mr. Biden's post-vice presidential think tank, on. Nov. 2, six days before the midterm elections, and turned them over to the. National. Archives. The. White. House also said that on. Dec. 20,. Mr. Biden's lawyers informed the. Justice. Department that additional documents with classified markings dating back to. Mr. Biden's time as vice president had been discovered in the garage of. Mr. Biden's home in. Wilmington, near his. Corvette. Stingray. That prompted the. FBI to retrieve the material. On. Thursday morning,. Mr. Biden's lawyer informed the government that an additional document bearing classified markings was identified at the president's home in. Wilmington. On. Thursday,. Attorney. General. Merrick. Garland named. Robert. Hur, a former. U.S. attorney during the. Trump administration, as special counsel to examine the classified documents case. President. Biden said. Thursday a \"small number\" of classified documents from his time as vice president were found at his home and in his personal library. Attorney. General. Merrick. Garland outlined the decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate. The. White. House has said. Mr. Biden didn't know the documents had been stored in the two locations nor did he know what was in the documents. The president, during a news conference. Tuesday that capped off a visit to. Mexico, said he was surprised and was cooperating on the matter. Mr. Biden's lawyer,. Richard. Sauber, has said the. White. House is confident that the. Justice. Department review \"will show that these documents were inadvertently misplaced, and the president and his lawyers acted promptly upon discovery of this mistake.\". Republicans have accused the. Justice. Department of maintaining a double standard on the issue of retention of classified documents because it obtained a warrant to search the. Florida home of former. President. Donald. Trump over his holding of top secret documents as part of a criminal investigation. The. Justice. Department has indicated that part of its investigation includes potential obstruction, after the issue was referred to prosecutors. Archives following months of negotiations with. Mr. Trump's has denied wrongdoing and described the investigation as a witch hunt. Some of. President. Biden's current advisers worked with him during his final days as vice president, including counselor. Steve. Ricchetti, who was. Mr. Biden's last vice presidential chief of staff, communications director. Kate. Bedingfield, who held the same position from to , and chief speechwriter. Vinay. Reddy. The. White. House has referred questions about the documents to the. Justice. Department, which declined to comment. Former aides said the vice president's general counsel's office oversaw the documents retention 's executive assistant at the time,. Kathy. Chung, was most heavily involved in the packing up of the office, according to former aides, but was helped -level staff members. Ms. Chung, who now serves as deputy director of protocol for. Defense. Secretary. Lloyd. Austin, was interviewed late last year about the discovered documents, according to a person familiar with the matter. The. Pentagon on. Friday declined to make. Ms. Chung available for comment and referred calls to the. Justice. Department, which declined to comment. The. Washington,. D.C., office building that houses the. Penn. Biden. Center for. Diplomacy and. Global. Engagement,. Mr. Biden's post-vice presidential think tank, where aides discovered 'a small number' of classified documents last year. Former aides described a frenetic few weeks before. Mr. Trump took office as. Mr. Biden crisscrossed the nation and embarked on a final foreign trip to. Ukraine and. Switzerland shortly before the inauguration. That busy travel schedule created new documents and papers up until the final day and complicated the packing process, they said. With many senior staff members on the road with. Mr. Biden, some aides described a depleted staff in. Washington trying to clear the vice president's offices as the transition of power loomed. Some members of. Mr. Biden staff had already departed their roles, they said, and those who remained worked to maintain daily briefings and operations in a hectic final sprint while sorting through documents and belongings that were no longer needed. During his final two weeks,. Mr. Biden presided over. Congress for the counting of the electoral votes for the election, and then took a trip to. California, where he appeared at a fundraiser for then. Los. Angeles. Mayor. Eric. Garcetti and delivered a speech at a healthcare conference in. San. Francisco. After departing. California,. Mr. Biden attended an event in. Chicago with outgoing. President. Barack. Obama and then stopped in. Detroit to visit the. North. American. International. Auto. Show. Days later,. Mr. Biden was surprised by. Mr. Obama with the presentation of the. Presidential. Medal of. Freedom at the. White. House, an event that brought together the then-vice president's large extended family. Mr. Biden then traveled to. New. York for an appearance on. ABC's \"The. View,\" where he noted that he had personally written a classified memorandum for. Vice. President-elect. Mike. Pence. \"He'll call me and ask about, or. I'll call him about what's going on in. Ukraine, what's going on here, what's going on there,\". Mr. Biden said at the time. The capstone of his final days was a trip to. Kyiv for a meeting with then-Ukrainian. President. Petro. Poroshenko. Among the classified documents discovered in the locales associated with. Mr. Biden was a briefing paper related to. Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the matter. Vice. President. Biden in. Kyiv,. Ukraine, with. Ukrainian. President. Petro. Poroshenko, on one of. Mr. Biden's final days in office in. January . From there,. Mr. Biden flew to. Davos,. Switzerland, for the. World. Economic. Forum, where he addressed the forum, quipping to the audience, \"I'll be vice president of the. United. States for 48 more hours.\". The stop in. Davos included a meeting with. Chinese. President. Xi and his aides landed back at. Joint. Base. Andrews on the evening of. Jan. 18, with the inauguration a little more than a day away. While aboard. Air. Force. Two,. Mr. Biden spoke with the prime minister of. Kosovo in an effort to defuse tensions with. Serbia, and held separate conversations with the leaders of the. Republic of. Cyprus,. Northern. Cyprus and. Greece to discuss settlement talks in the region. His final days in office also included a call with. Iraqi. Prime. Minister. Haider al-Abadi regarding the fight against. ISIL, and a meeting with the prime minister of. Ukraine during his stop in. Kyiv. The. General. Services.

A top German official said Germany would follow up on its pledge to send main battle tanks if other Western allies do so.\nMr. Zelensky tweeted that the U.K.’s decision “will not only strengthen us on the battlefield, but also send the right signal to other partners.” The commander in chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in December that the army needs 300 tanks to win back territory the Russians conquered last year, an analysis that Western military officials agree with. \nIn its statement, the British government said it would accelerate diplomatic and military support to aid Ukraine’s efforts to push back Russian forces as the anniversary of the war approaches late next month. “The Prime Minister is clear that a long and static war only serves Russia’s ends,” the statement said.\nThe initial provision of a small number of advanced tanks won’t by itself make a big or immediate difference on the battlefield, said Franz-Stefan Gady, a fellow with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. The logistics of setting up supply chains, fuel lines and trained crews for the complex machinery means the West isn’t likely to be able to deliver tanks in the kinds of numbers that would make a significant impact for at least many months to come.\nChallenger 2 tanks in a NATO exercise last spring in Estonia. PHOTO: BEN BIRCHALL/PA WIRE/ZUMA PRESS\nThat said, even providing a few dozen tanks means creating the repair yards and logistical centers that could make it much easier to send the next round of heavy combat vehicles. It signals a lasting commitment to building up Ukraine’s military, countering Russian President Vladimir Putin’s bet that the West will soon tire of aiding Ukraine, said Mr. Gady.\n“It will send a clear message that the West is in for the long haul,” he said. “Even for these small [numbers of] tanks you would need to build up a logistical supply chain. You could slowly build on that.”\nThere are some 2,000 Leopard 2 tanks held by 13 militaries across Europe including Turkey, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank. It notes that global stocks of these tanks are in varying states of readiness. Canada, for example, has an inventory of more than 80, but half are set aside for training purposes. For the moment, the only other country that has made a specific pledge is Poland, which has offered a company—typically 14 tanks.\nThe Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which coordinates support for Ukraine and includes defense ministers and military officials from around the world, is due to meet Jan 20. Members are expected to discuss how best to support Kyiv. German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said Thursday that Germany shouldn’t stand in the way of countries that want to send Leopards to Ukraine.\nRussia’s Embassy in the U.K. said Saturday that the tanks are “unlikely to help the Armed Forces of Ukraine turn the tide on the battlefield, and they will become a legitimate large target for Russian guns,” in comments carried by Russian state news agency TASS.\nBritish officials believe that, as the war in Ukraine shifts to a new phase, it makes sense to provide the Ukrainian army with heavy armor, something that was almost inconceivable just a few months ago. Russia is mobilizing personnel to the front lines, such as at the eastern city of Bakhmut, creating a numerical advantage that could work against Ukraine. If Ukraine is to mount a spring counterattack, it needs tanks to clear Russian lines without incurring huge losses in personnel, according to military analysts.\nAdvertisement\nFrance has pledged to send AMX-10 armored vehicles to Ukraine. PHOTO: EMMANUEL DUNAND/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nMoreover, some British officials feel that the West needs to more aggressively tilt the advantage in Ukraine’s favor with a larger supply of weapons to quickly help Ukraine into a position of relative strength from which it can negotiate an end to the war with Russia. Without this infusion of weaponry, they fear the war could drag on for years.  \nThe British Army’s Challenger 2 is more than two decades old, but it will still be the most advanced tank the Ukrainians have fielded in battle. Up until now, most of the heavy armor provided by NATO allies such as Poland have been old Soviet-era tanks. The U.K. has a stock of around 227 Challenger 2 tanks and is in the process of replacing them with a modernized version.  \nBiden administration officials have said they don’t object to other countries providing tanks and welcome the British contribution. Meanwhile, they remain open to providing U.S. Abrams tanks to Ukraine but haven’t decided to do so, nor do they anticipate that tanks would be announced in the near future, officials said this past week. \n“This is something that we absolutely agree that Ukraine does need tanks,” said Laura Cooper, a top Pentagon policy official, earlier this month. But the U.S. remains worried about the training and logistics required to use an Abrams tank, which Ms. Cooper said is a “gas guzzler.”\nThe U.S. wants to make sure Ukrainians can operate and maintain the tanks before the U.S. provides them, administration officials said. In addition to the British tanks, the U.S. and the Netherlands paid to refurbish T-72 tanks, which are arriving on the battlefield in Ukraine this month. \nUntil recent weeks, the issue of tanks was largely taboo. Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other allies such as Australia supplied armored military vehicles that separately have many characteristics of tanks, such as heavy armor, big guns and caterpillar treads, but not all in one system.\nFrance recently said it would send AMX-10s, which have a cannon but are considered light tanks because they have wheels rather than treads. The U.S. said earlier this month that it plans to send Bradley Fighting Vehicles, which have treads and heavy armor but don’t carry a large cannon, as a main battle tank does.\nBojan Pancevski contributed to this article.\nWrite to Max Colchester at Max.Colchester@wsj.com and Drew Hinshaw at drew.hinshaw@wsj.com\nThe War in Ukraine\nNews and insights, selected by the editors\nThe Tensions Surrounding Ukraine’s Crimea\nTrump Rebukes Putin After Russian Attack on Kyiv\nTrump Blames Zelensky as Ukraine Peace Talks Stumble\nZelensky Pushes Back on U.S. Peace Plan\nUkraine and Russia Had Cease-Fires Before.

         "Title: Thousands of Israelis Protest Netanyahu Government’s Judicial Overhaul Plans\n\nAdvertisement\nWORLD\nMIDDLE EAST\nThousands of Israelis Protest Netanyahu Government’s Judicial Overhaul Plans\nThe newly sworn-in ruling coalition has vowed to curb the judiciary’s power\nBy Aaron Boxerman\nUpdated Jan. 14, 2023 4:28 pm ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(4 min)\nIsraelis protested in Tel Aviv Saturday, with some waving signs calling for the government to ‘take its hands off the court.’ PHOTO: RONEN ZVULUN/REUTERS\nTEL AVIV—Tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities Saturday night to protest the newly sworn-in Netanyahu government’s plan to overhaul the country’s judicial system, saying that such a move could weaken Israel’s democracy.\nActivists and the political opposition say the ruling coalition’s proposals, which aim at curbing the power of Israel’s judiciary, could undermine the country’s existing system of checks and balances. The proposed changes include giving the ruling coalition more say in which judges are appointed, limiting the top court’s ability to strike down laws and allowing a simple majority of lawmakers to override the Supreme Court should it strike down legislation.\nMore than 80,000 Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv’s Habima Square on Saturday night, according to estimates by local media, standing in pouring rain under a sea of umbrellas, some waving signs calling for the government to “take its hands off the court.”\n“There’s a group of extremists that’s trying to take over the country and pass laws that will hurt us for years to come,” said Yaniv Davidson, a 45-year-old resident of Tel Aviv. “It’s frightening what’s happening.”\nThe new coalition is led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, who is on trial for corruption charges he denies. Political analysts call Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition—made of right-wing and religious parties—the most conservative in Israeli history.\nMr. Netanyahu and his allies have defended the wide-ranging proposals as necessary to restrain what they deem rampant judicial overreach. The premier argues that his victory at the ballot box in November shows that the wider public backs changing the system. The proposed bills must undergo a lengthy parliamentary process before becoming law.\nIsraelis protesters say the overhaul could weaken the country’s democracy.

Israelis took to the streets in. Tel. Aviv and other. Israeli cities. Saturday night to protest the newly sworn-in. Netanyahu government's plan to overhaul the country's judicial system, saying that such a move could weaken. Israel's democracy. Activists and the political opposition say the ruling coalition's proposals, which aim at curbing the power of. Israel's judiciary, could undermine the country's existing system of checks and balances. The proposed changes include giving the ruling coalition more say in which judges are appointed, limiting the top court's ability to strike down laws and allowing a simple majority of lawmakers to override the. Supreme. Court should it strike down legislation. More than 80,000. Israelis gathered in. Tel. Aviv's. Habima. Square on. Saturday night, according to estimates , standing in pouring rain under a sea of umbrellas, some waving signs calling for the government to \"take its hands off the court.\" \"There's a group of extremists that's trying to take over the country and pass laws that will hurt us for years to come,\" said.

Mr. Netanyahu and his allies have defended the wide-ranging proposals as necessary to restrain what they deem rampant judicial overreach. The premier argues that his victory at the ballot box in. November shows that the wider public backs changing the system. The proposed bills must undergo a lengthy parliamentary process before becoming law. Israelis protesters say the overhaul could weaken the country's democracy. \"We spoke about this before the elections, and we've received a clear mandate from the public on this,\". Mr. Netanyahu said. Friday afternoon. Supporters of the plan say it is necessary to create a fair balance between the power of the court and the legislature after decades in which they say the country's. Supreme.

But at times of economic upheaval, such as during the pandemic, the gap between the two can widen.\nDuring the past two years, supply-chain disruptions related to the pandemic and higher energy costs linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused inflation to outpace wage gains. The effect of these supply factors is now fading, putting less pressure on consumer prices.\nBoth pay increases and inflation have been cooling since the middle of last year. But for the past two months inflation has been easing more than wages, giving paychecks a boost.\nAs a result, this could be the year that workers start seeing real wage gains again. \n“The question for 2023 is which moderates faster: inflation or wages,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, a payroll processor.\nOrdinarily, if paychecks aren’t keeping up with inflation, households would be forced to cut back on spending, which could send the economy into a downturn.\nIn this case, households benefited from huge amounts of pent-up savings, thanks to multiple rounds of federal stimulus and reduced spending during the early months of the pandemic. Families tapped into those savings last year to keep up their consumption.\nInflation-adjusted consumer spending either rose or held level every month of last year through November, according to the latest data available, indicating that consumers have yet to pull back.\nAmy Hekman, of Grand Rapids, Mich., lost her job at an early-childhood nonprofit early in the pandemic.

Fed researchers estimated the total amount of excess savings fell to $1.7 trillion midway through 2022, from $2.3 trillion in the third quarter of 2021.\n“As of now, the consumer is still holding up,” said Ms. Richardson. “This is really a race against the clock to restore inflation to more tolerable levels and then let the job market do what it does, which in a tight labor market is keep wages robust.

Join the conversation below.\nWages tend to be “stickier” than inflation, said Credit Suisse economist Jeremy Schwartz. They don’t rise and fall as rapidly as consumer prices. That means wage gains could exceed inflation for a little while until they come back into rough alignment, he said.\nMr. Schwartz sees year-over-year wage increases falling to just above 4% by the end of 2023, while inflation weakens to around 3% on the year.\n“In terms of not seeing such painful price increases and having your income stretch further, this could be a pretty good year for consumers,” he said.\nDespite the possible return of real wage gains, workers could suffer if the economy tips into recession this year, as many economists expect. A recession would likely lead to layoffs and push up the unemployment rate from December’s 3.5%. Fed officials see the unemployment rate rising to 4.6% by the end of the year.\n“If you retain a job you’ll be in better shape,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. “It’s just that there’s going to be an increased risk of layoffs for this year.”\nWrite to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com\nInflation and the Economy\nAnalysis from The Wall Street Journal, selected by the editors\nInflation Has Cooled, but Americans Are Still Seething Over Prices\nLower Interest Rates Don’t Guarantee a Soft Landing\nThe American Dream Feels Out of Reach for Most\nInflation's Impact on the Poor vs. the Rich\nSHOW CONVERSATION (185)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nFurther Reading\nPowell Steers New Strategy for a World Where Very Low Rates Are No Sure Thing\nTreasury Yields Rise Amid Trade Talk Developments\nWeek Ahead for FX, Bonds: Focus on Trade News, U.S. Inflation, Retail Sales Data\nOPINION\nA New Strategy to Fight Inflation\nWhy the Fed Isn’t Ready to Join Other Central Banks in Cutting Rates",

VA officials are trying to find ways to address concerns many veterans have about seeking mental-health treatment or discussing their guns and firearms safety. \nMost veterans are now eligible for 30 days of inpatient or 90 days of outpatient care, and the VA said it is streamlining access to private facilities for those deemed to be at imminent risk of self-harm. The change expands eligibility for such services to also include the approximately nine million veterans who aren’t enrolled in the VA system.\nThe VA effort has also included a partnership with the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a major firearms trade group, to bridge political and ideological divisions. Next week, for the first time, the VA will headline part of the NSSF’s shooting, hunting and outdoor trade event known as SHOT Show, the nation’s largest firearms trade show. \nThe check-in desk at a VA outpatient clinic in Portland, Maine. PHOTO: PATRICK OUELLETTE/PORTLAND PRESS HERALD/GETTY IMAGES\nThe renewed push to address veteran suicide-by-firearm began during the Trump administration in 2017 and 2018, said Dr. Matthew Miller, head of suicide prevention for the VA. \n“We sat down at VA and said we need to do something more,” he said in an interview. “We said, ‘Why don’t we do something about the factor that’s involved with 70% of suicides?’ And that’s firearms.”\nVeterans are more likely than civilians to own firearms, and they are more likely to use them for suicide, according to VA statistics. And gun owners can become defensive about any effort to address firearm restrictions, which precluded discussion of preventing firearm suicide in the past, said Ari Freilich, state policy director at Giffords Law Center, which seeks to end gun violence.\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nThe 10-Point\nA personal, guided tour to the best scoops and stories every day in The Wall Street Journal.\nPreview\nSubscribed\n“It’s really important to talk about where we were a decade ago,” he said, with gun companies and lobbyists all but refusing to talk about links between firearm access and suicide. \nSince then, groups such as the NSSF have begun to address the need to talk about firearm suicide. Mr. Freilich said the industry should have talked about these matters long ago, and that it continues to profit off weapons that bring people harm, but it is important to recognize the crucial change that has taken place.\n“We need credible messengers to reach people where they are and trust it,” he said. “That’s such a bedrock of our work.”\nWhile there are political policy debates about ways to address firearms issues through legislation, these disparate groups have tried to find common ground and focus on solutions that can save lives. One such solution is widespread use of gun locks and having gun owners put what is known as time and distance between themselves and firearms and ammunition when possible. That includes storing ammunition separately from weapons and even persuading gun owners to trust someone close to them to safeguard their guns for them when they might be in crisis.\nIn 2016, NSSF joined with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention after gun retailers and members began asking more about the issue, said Dr. Doreen Marshall, vice president of mission engagement for the suicide-prevention organization.\n“NSSF saying, ‘This is important’—it changed the dialogue nationally,” she said.\nThen in 2019, the NSSF joined with the VA to bring the message to veterans.\nRep. Chris Stewart says his work with veterans made him realize the acute crisis that needed to be addressed.  PHOTO: GEORGE FREY/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n“Organizations like the VA recognize that we have the ability to reach a community that they might not be able to reach,” said Joe Bartozzi, president and chief executive of the NSSF. “I’d like to believe that it has helped to open up the dialogue.”\nMr. Bartozzi said veterans need to understand that they can get assistance for mental-health crises and not be in danger of having their weapons confiscated, a common concern among the demographic. He said his organization’s members have asked for more training and information on suicide prevention, and because it is coming from their trusted organization, it has opened up the conversation in ways that weren’t possible in the past.\nThe VA has tailored messaging so that it focuses not on restricting access to firearms but on safety surrounding the use, storage and understanding of firearms, Dr. Miller of the VA said.\nAdvertisement\nThat includes advocating for training doctors and mental-health professionals in the basics of gun culture and concerns gun owners have about seeking mental-health treatment. Dr. Miller said such training modules have become standard at the VA. \n“Suicide is preventable, and once you understand that concept, there’s no reason not to get involved,” Mr. Bartozzi said.\nEven as the VA has expanded efforts, officials say more can be done, especially in tracking outcomes. Dr. Miller said the VA doesn’t have reliable statistics on the outcomes of many of the programs because it is nearly impossible to point to one variable in something as complicated as suicide. But he said this year funding has been set aside to better assess outcomes. \nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nIs encouraging gun safety an effective way to prevent suicides? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\nAccording to the VA’s most recent statistics, veteran suicide rates were up in 2018 and then fell for two straight years (the department’s statistics lag behind by two years). But suicide among veterans remains higher than among the civilian population. \nMany lawmakers in Washington have sought to address suicide prevention, and some of the biggest proponents of such measures say they have to keep some distance from efforts like those being made by the VA and the NSSF.\n“We have, by intention, stayed out of those conversations,” said Rep. Chris Stewart (R., Utah) one of the most vocal lawmakers when it comes to suicide prevention and a primary driver of legislation establishing the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.\n“If you have a Republican who’s supporting something, Democrats are suspicious. And the other way around,” he said. When Mr. Stewart first came to Congress in 2013, he didn’t intend to champion suicide prevention, he said, but his work with veterans made him realize the acute crisis that needed to be addressed. \n“I’m so glad other people are involved, and they see this as a problem that they want to get involved in,” he said.\nHelp is available: Reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) by dialing or texting 988. \nWrite to Ben Kesling at ben.kesling@wsj.com\nSHOW CONVERSATION (29)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nFurther Reading\nTreasury Yields Rise as U.S. Services Sector Keeps Expanding\nU.S. Activity Rebounds But Inflation Heats Up on Tariff Concerns",

PHOTO: CAROLYN KASTER/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nHouse Republicans are seeking two years of visitor logs from President Biden’s Delaware home as part of a push for more details about documents marked as classified that were found in Mr. Biden’s home and at a Washington office he used after his vice presidency.\n“Given the serious national security implications, the White House must provide the Wilmington residence’s visitor log,” House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R., Ky.) wrote in a Sunday letter to White House chief of staff Ron Klain.\nMr. Comer also requested documentation of searches Biden aides conducted, including the identity of the aides and the dates of their searches.\nThe White House declined to comment on whether it would comply with the request. Mr. Biden was in Atlanta to mark Martin Luther King Jr. Day with an appearance at Dr. King’s Ebenezer Baptist Church. The White House publishes visitor logs for visits to the White House, renewing a practice that the Trump administration had discontinued, but doesn’t release logs for visits to Mr. Biden’s residences elsewhere.\nThe White House confirmed last week a CBS report that Mr. Biden’s attorneys found documents marked as classified on Nov. 2 at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a Washington think tank. The Biden administration said the president’s lawyers turned the documents over to the National Archives a day later.\nIn December, aides to Mr. Biden found additional classified documents in the garage of the president’s home in Wilmington. Another document was found in January at the residence, and on Saturday the White House said five additional classified pages were found there as well.\nMr. Comer has launched an investigation, saying his committee had concerns Mr. Biden “has compromised sources and methods with his own mishandling of classified documents.”\nThe revelations of the documents have drawn comparisons to the FBI’s warrant-backed search of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida amid a criminal investigation into the handling of classified materials found there. Agents seized more than 11,000 documents from the residence in August, including roughly 100 marked as classified, after a monthslong effort to get Mr. Trump’s team to relinquish documents. The Justice Department appointed Special Counsel Jack Smith to take over that investigation.\nOn Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Robert Hur as a separate special counsel to examine the discovery of the documents marked as classified at Mr. Biden’s home and think-tank office.\nOn Sunday Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, said he approved of Mr. Hur’s appointment.\n“All we’re looking for is equal treatment,” Mr. Raskin said on CNN.\nDemocrats note that the search of Mar-a-Lago came after extensive negotiations between the National Archives and Mr. Trump’s team for the return of the documents, and the National Archives enlisted the Justice Department.

Al Sharpton on what would have been Dr. King’s 94th birthday. “Will we choose democracy over autocracy, community over chaos, love over hate? These are the questions of our time.”\nThe remarks came a day after Mr. Biden traveled to Atlanta for another celebration commemorating Dr. King, whom he referred to as one of his “only political heroes,” at Ebenezer Baptist Church. Speaking before an audience that included Dr. King’s sister, Christine King Farris, and other members of his family, Mr. Biden became the first sitting president to deliver a Sunday sermon at the historic church where Dr. King often preached. \nIn both speeches, Mr. Biden struck a somber tone as he spoke of an “inflection point” for civil rights, democracy and social justice. Whereas the president spent much of his Sunday sermon drawing on the teachings of Dr. King, whom he praised as a “nonviolent warrior for justice,” Mr. Biden’s remarks at Monday’s breakfast were more centered around his political agenda and congressional Republicans.\nMartin Luther King Jr. Honored\nThe nation celebrated the life and achievements of the U.S. civil-rights leader on Monday\n1 of 2\nANDREW HARNIK/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n1\n2\nMr. Biden said he stands ready to work with the new Republican House majority, even as he criticized GOP lawmakers for blocking police reform and voting rights legislation.

The company also provides a delivery guarantee, which provides some compensation to shoppers if their merchandise isn’t delivered on time. \nOrders placed through AliExpress fell in Alibaba’s last three fiscal quarterly reports.

Once one of China’s fastest-growing tech businesses, Alibaba’s revenue for its last two fiscal quarters was little changed from the year-earlier periods as a result of a slowdown in consumer spending during China’s strict zero-Covid policy. The company also swung to a net loss in the July-to-September quarter. \nLast year, Alibaba Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said globalization was one of the company’s three key strategies, along with consumption and cloud computing.

PHOTO: KEVIN DIETSCH/GETTY IMAGES\nWASHINGTON—U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will meet with senior Chinese official Liu He this week as the two superpowers try to rekindle a relationship that accounts for much of the world’s economic activity but has grown tense over technology access, trade policy and Taiwan. \nThe pair will meet Wednesday in Zurich, where Ms. Yellen is stopping ahead of a multicountry tour through Africa that is aimed in part at countering China’s influence on the continent. Mr. Liu, who is expected to step down from his post in March but is close to Chinese President Xi Jinping, is expected to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The two sides arranged to meet in a third country while they are both abroad.\nSenior U.S. and Chinese officials have only recently started meeting again after China cut off most such communications following then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan last year. President Biden and Mr. Xi in November agreed to resume contacts among top officials, and Ms. Yellen is looking at traveling to China after Secretary of State Antony Blinken visits next month, according to people familiar with the matter. U.S. officials have been unsure who Ms. Yellen’s next counterpart will be after a Chinese government reshuffle. \nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWhat’s News\nCatch up on the headlines, understand the news and make better decisions, free in your inbox daily. Enjoy a free article in every edition.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nThe renewed engagement comes as both countries try to recalibrate their relationship with their top geopolitical rival—and one of their closest economic partners. Chinese officials are moving to try to revitalize their economy and soften their rhetoric toward Washington. The U.S. and Ms. Yellen, meanwhile, are scrutinizing perceived national-security risks in Chinese technology, while also aiming to avoid undue harm to an engine of global economic growth. \n“Secretary Yellen has got a big challenge,” said Matt Goodman, senior vice president for economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. “That’s making the case for growth on one hand and on the other being forceful for the U.S. need to protect our national security.”\nA Treasury official said the department doesn’t view protecting national security and promoting global economic growth to be at odds with each other. Regular communication with Chinese officials can help accomplish both goals, the Treasury official said. \nThe U.S. last year imposed wide-ranging export controls on advanced semiconductors, a step aimed at hobbling China’s ability to develop its military capabilities. The Biden administration is working on an executive order on screening U.S. investment in certain Chinese technology sectors, including advanced semiconductors. \nWith both the export controls that are in place and the potential outbound investment restrictions, some Treasury officials are concerned that the steps could slow China’s access to technology for ordinary commercial purposes as well. Ms. Yellen, who has pushed for U.S. companies to become less reliant on China, is concerned that China could retaliate against the U.S. economy, according to people familiar with her thinking. If Chinese officials see U.S. policies as too punitive, they could cut off U.S. access to goods such as solar panels, for example. \n“The defense and intelligence agencies are frequently going to have more restrictive views on these questions than the Treasury,” said Mark Sobel, a former Treasury official who is the U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think tank. “Treasury’s macro-analysis well understands there are spillovers and spillbacks and interdependencies, and these are issues that need to be managed for the global economy.”\nChina’s Liu He previously encouraged the U.S. to relax its tariffs on the country’s goods. PHOTO: LEAH MILLIS/REUTERS\nTreasury officials, who have held a series of meetings with private-sector participants to discuss the possible investment controls on China, have sought to more narrowly target the White House order, according to people familiar with the matter. Outstanding questions include how many Chinese technology sectors would be subject to the controls, whether the government would outright ban investment in them and how investors would comply with the new rules, these people said.\nThe difficulty of resolving those questions has slowed progress on crafting the executive order, according to people familiar with the talks. \n“There’s not even consensus around how to scope this,” said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has studied export controls. \nThe Treasury Department is also leading a review into the U.S. operations of TikTok, which is owned by a Chinese parent company, at the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., an interagency government panel.

Join the conversation below.\nAfter her meeting with Mr. Liu, Ms. Yellen will travel to Senegal, Zambia and South Africa. China has deepened its ties on the African continent in recent years, lending to many low-income countries. Zambia has struggled to reach an agreement with its Chinese creditors to restructure its debt. Ms. Yellen has repeatedly criticized China’s behavior as a creditor as the U.S. tries to bolster its own influence in Africa. \n“It seems like it’s a form of catch-up here,” Rama Yade, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Africa center, said of the Biden administration’s renewed outreach to Africa. \nOn trade, Ms. Yellen has called for “friendshoring,” a term used to describe companies reorienting their supply chains into countries such as India to be less dependent on China—drawing criticism from Chinese officials. \nBut she has also pushed for the U.S. to relax some of its tariffs on Chinese goods. When Ms. Yellen and Mr. Liu spoke in a call over the summer, Mr. Liu said he had seen Ms. Yellen’s comments on tariffs and he encouraged the U.S. to relax them, according to people familiar with the call. \nAdvertisement\nWrite to Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 17, 2023, print edition as 'Yellen Seeks to Smooth Ties With Beijing'.\nSHOW CONVERSATION (98)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nFurther Reading\nWhy the Fed Isn’t Ready to Join Other Central Banks in Cutting Rates\nFed Reviewing Its Secret Ratings for the Nation’s Biggest Banks\nOPINION\nKevin Warsh on Fed Policy and Independence\nTrump Says Powell is a Loser.

         "Jan. 16, 500 am. ET 98 6 min. Treasury. Secretary. Janet. Yellen must weigh national-security risks in. Chinese technology while avoiding harm to an economic-growth engine. WASHINGTONU.S. Treasury. Secretary. Janet. Yellen will meet with senior. Chinese official. Liu. He this week as the two superpowers try to rekindle a relationship that accounts for much of the world's economic activity but has grown tense over technology access, trade policy and. Taiwan. The pair will meet. Wednesday in. Zurich, where. Ms. Yellen is stopping ahead of a multicountry tour through. Africa that is aimed in part at countering. China's influence on the , who is expected to step down from his post in. March but is close to. Chinese. President. Xi. Jinping, is expected to attend the. World. Economic. Forum in. Davos,. Switzerland. The two sides arranged to meet in a third country while they are both abroad. Senior. U.S. and. Chinese officials have only recently started meeting again after. China cut off most such communications following then-House. Speaker. Nancy. Pelosi's visit to. Taiwan last year. President. Biden and. Mr. Xi in. November agreed to resume contacts among top officials, and. Ms. Yellen is looking at traveling to. China after. Secretary of. State. Antony. Blinken visits next month, according to people familiar with the matter. U.S. officials have been unsure who. Ms. Yellen's next counterpart will be after a. Chinese government reshuffle. The renewed engagement comes as both countries try to recalibrate their relationship with their top geopolitical rivaland one of their closest economic partners. Chinese officials are moving to try to revitalize their economy and soften their rhetoric toward. Washington. The. U.S. and. Ms. Yellen, meanwhile, are scrutinizing perceived national-security risks in. Chinese technology, while also aiming to avoid undue harm to an engine of global economic growth. \"Secretary. Yellen has got a big challenge,\" said. Matt. Goodman, senior vice president for economics at the. Center for. Strategic and. International. Studies, a. Washington think tank. \"That's making the case for growth on one hand and on the other being forceful for the. U.S. need to protect our national security.\". A. Treasury official said the department doesn't view protecting national security and promoting global economic growth to be at odds with each other. Regular communication with. Chinese officials can help accomplish both goals, the. Treasury official said. The. U.S. last year imposed wide-ranging export controls on advanced semiconductors, a step aimed at hobbling. China's ability to develop its military capabilities. The. Biden administration is working on an executive order on screening. U.S. investment in certain. Chinese technology sectors, including advanced semiconductors. With both the export controls that are in place and the potential outbound investment restrictions, some. Treasury officials are concerned that the steps could slow. China's access to technology for ordinary commercial purposes as , who has pushed for. U.S. companies to become less reliant on. China, is concerned that. China could retaliate against the. U.S. economy, according to people familiar with her thinking. If. Chinese officials see.

Forecasters say it would be the end of a series of storms that have hit the state since Christmas. Photo: Caroline Brehman/Shutterstock\nCalifornia was hit again by rain and snow Monday as the state moved toward what forecasters said would be the end of a series of storms that have battered it since Christmas.\nThe nine storms known as atmospheric rivers—flowing columns of condensed water vapor in the atmosphere that produce significant precipitation—have killed at least 19 people, flooded communities, shut down highways and cut power to tens of thousands of homes. The storms and accompanying damage have been more intense in the north and middle regions of the state than in the south.\nSee more...\nMonday’s storm wasn’t expected to bring as much precipitation as previous ones, but residents were warned to remain vigilant as the combination of already saturated ground and storm water flowing downstream could still cause flooding and mudslides, forecasters said.\nThe National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning until early Tuesday in the Sierra Nevada, a mountain range that runs along the eastern edge of California. An additional 1-3 feet of snow forecast for the area and wind gusts of as high as 60 miles an hour would make travel difficult if not impossible, officials said.\nOne smaller, fast-moving storm system is forecast to arrive late Wednesday through early Thursday.\nFrom there, a stretch of dry weather is expected across California through at least the weekend and likely into next week, said Colby Goatley, a National Weather Service meteorologist.\n“Hopefully by this weekend, it’s the light at the end of the tunnel,” Mr. Goatley said.\nThe storms continued to wreak havoc in California over the holiday weekend. In San Diego, the National Weather Service warned residents Monday to avoid areas near the San Diego River that had flooded nearby roads, posting a picture of a car taken away by rushing waters. In San Joaquin County, the sheriff’s office issued a mandatory evacuation order for a mobile-home park as water flooded homes.\nFloodwaters beset a home in Brentwood, Calif.

On Monday, the statewide snowpack, which feeds into streams and rivers when it melts, was at 247 percent of the average for the date.\nPeople attempt to cross a street in San Diego on Monday.

         "Ban could prompt employers to use alternative mechanisms such as nondisclosure agreements",
         "Title: FTC Plan to Ban Noncompete Clauses Shifts Companies’ Focus\n\nFTC Plan to Ban Noncompete Clauses Shifts Companies’ Focus\nBan could prompt employers to use alternative mechanisms such as nondisclosure agreements\nDaniel Bachhuber at his home office in Tualatin, Ore. MASON TRINCA FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nBy\nLauren Weber\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 17, 2023 10:39 am ET\n292\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(6 min)\nBusinesses and lawyers are beginning to assess what the Federal Trade Commission’s proposed ban of noncompete clauses in employment contracts could mean for worker mobility, wages and the way future compensation agreements are structured. \nWhile a full or partial ban could expand the pool of potential hires, it also would weaken a tool that employers have come to rely on to retain talent and protect trade secrets and other proprietary information, lawyers say. More companies likely would turn to a patchwork of alternative mechanisms to keep people from leaving and taking valuable information with them, including nondisclosure agreements and employment contracts that reward longevity, they say. \nTHE JOURNAL.\nCould This Be the End of Noncompetes?\n16:36\n1x\nSUBSCRIBE\nAdd to Queue\nExplore Audio Center\n“Employers have operated with an understanding that they can protect their interests through noncompetes,” said Matthew Durham, a Salt Lake City-based attorney with Dorsey & Whitney LLP who advises companies on employment matters. “What you’re seeing, reflected in the FTC proposal and elsewhere, is a growing hostility to the idea that there should be those kinds of restrictions, and it’s changing the environment that employers have been comfortable with in the last number of years.”\nThe FTC proposed a ban this month on nearly all noncompetes, saying that the clauses—which typically prohibit workers from moving to a new employer or starting new ventures of their own—hamper competition in the labor market, suppress wages and hold back innovation and entrepreneurship. The proposal came in response to an executive order from President Biden in 2021.\nBusinesses say they impose noncompete clauses on employees to protect trade secrets and other confidential information, including customer lists and financial data.\nThe FTC contends that noncompete clauses discourage innovation and entrepreneurship. PHOTO: ERIC LEE FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nMr. Durham and others say they believe the FTC may narrow its rule after hearing comments from the public, including employers and business organizations that have already signaled their opposition to the current proposal.

         "Title: Robert Hur Leaves NFL Behind to Take On Special Counsel Role\n\nAdvertisement\nPOLITICS\nRobert Hur Leaves NFL Behind to Take On Special Counsel Role\nFormer prosecutor faces tough decisions in new post probing discovery of classified documents at Biden locales\nBy\nC. Ryan Barber\n,\nAruna Viswanatha\nand\nSadie Gurman\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(6 min)\nRobert Hur is a Justice Department veteran with experience in the George W. Bush and Donald Trump administrations, including as U.S. attorney for Maryland. PHOTO: MICHAEL MCCOY/REUTERS\nWASHINGTON—Weeks after adding the National Football League as a client, former prosecutor Robert Hur received a call from Attorney General Merrick Garland asking him to serve as the special counsel overseeing the investigation into classified documents found at a home and former office of President Biden. It was a request Mr. Hur told associates he didn’t feel he could refuse, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMr. Hur accepted the appointment clear-eyed about the reputational risks of taking on an investigation into a sitting president, according to people familiar with his considerations, especially as a separate special counsel investigates former President Donald Trump over his handling of classified documents found at his South Florida residence and private club, Mar-a-Lago.\nMr. Hur is expected to begin as special counsel at the end of January after winding down his work at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, the law firm he joined as a partner in 2021 after serving as the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Maryland. For Mr. Hur, the appointment entails leaving behind what promised to be a lucrative client in the NFL, which had turned to him to defend against a lawsuit brought by the Washington, D.C., attorney general.\n“This was clearly not a financially motivated decision,” said Rod Rosenstein, who served as deputy attorney general during the Trump administration and assigned Mr. Hur, at the time his top aide, to help oversee Robert Mueller’s special counsel inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. “Rob understands what he is getting into,” Mr. Rosenstein said. \nPresident Biden said Thursday that a “small number” of classified documents from his time as vice president were found at his home and in his personal library. Attorney General Merrick Garland outlined the decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate. Photo: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\nGibson Dunn explored a leave-of-absence arrangement to keep Mr. Hur affiliated with the firm, but the Justice Department rejected the idea, in part out of concern for potential conflicts of interest in what is expected to be a monthslong investigation, a person familiar with the discussions said.  \nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. In a statement, Gibson Dunn partner F. Joseph Warin said Mr. Hur “has excelled in every professional endeavor, and we are confident that he will discharge his responsibilities as Special Counsel with the same impeccable judgment and tireless work ethic that he has exhibited throughout his career.”\nIn Mr. Hur, the attorney general picked a Justice Department veteran with experience in the George W. Bush and Trump administrations and political savvy, former colleagues said.

Mr. Hur told associates he didn't feel he could refuse, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Hur accepted the appointment clear-eyed about the reputational risks of taking on an investigation into a sitting president, according to people familiar with his considerations, especially as a separate special counsel investigates former. President. Donald. Trump over his handling of classified documents found at his. South. Florida residence and private club,. Mar-a-Lago. Mr. Hur is expected to begin as special counsel at the end of. January after winding down his work at. Gibson,. Dunn. Crutcher, the law firm he joined as a partner in after serving as the. Trump-appointed. U.S. attorney in. Maryland. For. Mr. Hur, the appointment entails leaving behind what promised to be a lucrative client in the. NFL, which had turned to him to defend against a lawsuit brought ,. D.C., attorney general. \"This was clearly not a financially motivated decision,\" said. Rod. Rosenstein, who served as deputy attorney general during the. Trump administration and assigned. Mr. Hur, at the time his top aide, to help oversee. Robert. Mueller's special counsel inquiry into. Russian interference in the election. \"Rob understands what he is getting into,\". Mr. Rosenstein said. President. Biden said. Thursday that a \"small number\" of classified documents from his time as vice president were found at his home and in his personal library. Attorney. General. Merrick. Garland outlined the decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate. Gibson. Dunn explored a leave-of-absence arrangement to keep. Mr. Hur affiliated with the firm, but the. Justice. Department rejected the idea, in part out of concern for potential conflicts of interest in what is expected to be a monthslong investigation, a person familiar with the discussions said. A. Justice. Department spokesman declined to comment. In a statement,. Gibson. Dunn partner. F. Joseph. Warin said. Mr. Hur \"has excelled in every professional endeavor, and we are confident that he will discharge his responsibilities as. Special.

         "Title: The $385,000 Flight Attendant for Netflix’s Private Jet: ‘Where Do I Apply?’\n\nThe $385,000 Flight Attendant for Netflix’s Private Jet: ‘Where Do I Apply?’\nStreaming company’s job listing, with pay ranging from $60,000 to $385,000, goes viral\nPHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY CAM POLLACK/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL; ISTOCK (2); EPA/SHUTTERSTOCK\nBy\nAlyssa Lukpat\nand\nSuryatapa Bhattacharya\n75\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(6 min)\nWanted: A Netflix Inc. NFLX 1.51%\nincrease; green up pointing triangle\nflight attendant to work on the company’s private jet. Asking salary: As much as $385,000.\nIn a time of downsizing at many top tech companies, Netflix set the internet abuzz this week with what some described as an unusual job listing. The streaming company wants a trained flight attendant to be in charge of trips on its super midsize jet, according to the posting on its website. The employee must have outstanding customer service skills and safety training.\nThe pay range for the role is listed as $60,000 to $385,000, depending on the person’s background, according to Netflix. By comparison, the median flight attendant annual salary in 2021 was about $61,000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nNetflix didn’t return requests for comment.\nThe job listing went viral. “Where do I apply?!” was a common refrain. Some social-media users couldn’t believe the wide pay range, a likely effect of new pay-transparency disclosure laws enacted recently in several states including California, where Netflix is based.\nOthers were surprised Netflix was advertising the role at all, as the company has been focused on reining in spending. Last year Netflix posted two consecutive quarters of subscriber losses for the first time in its history and laid off hundreds of employees. But the year ended with what the company called a “brighter finish,” as Netflix beat its own forecast for subscriber gains in the fourth quarter. \nAs interest rates rise and companies tighten their belts, white-collar workers have taken the brunt of layoffs and job cuts, breaking with the usual pattern leading into a downturn. WSJ explains why many professionals are getting the pink slip first. Illustration: Adele Morgan\nFor some flight attendants, the biggest surprise was the potential paycheck. Lauren Pires, a corporate flight attendant based in Miami, said she has never heard of anyone in her industry who has made $385,000.\n“This has to be quite, quite the position to be at this salary,” said Ms. Pires, who has worked on private jets for over a decade. She said a lot of corporate flight attendants make six figures but not as much as the maximum pay on the Netflix listing.\nThe job asks the new hire to balance a highflying life on its Gulfstream G550 jet charter trips with the mundane.\nNetflix’s corporate aircraft services are available to some executives and their families and guests for personal use, according to the company. “Consider amounts related to such travel as a perquisite,” the company’s compensation disclosure says.\nA private jet trip is a common perk at some big companies, often for security reasons.\n“The aviation team helps Netflix reach the world more efficiently and effectively so the company can continue to create joy around the world,” according to the job posting, which noted that the recruit will be based near Netflix’s Silicon Valley headquarters.\nThe flight attendant should be capable of standing for long periods, helping with loading baggage, purchasing and loading aircraft stock before a trip. The person, who will join a team of attendants, must also be a self-starter: “The flight attendant will need to operate with little direction and a lot of self-motivation,” according to the job posting.\nNetflix’s corporate aircraft services are available to some executives and their families and guests for personal use. PHOTO: ROBYN BECK/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nThe position would likely not have much job security or scheduling protections, said Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents 50,000 flight attendants. Corporate flight attendants sometimes don’t know where they are about to fly when they show up to work.\nMs. Pires, the corporate flight attendant, said her peers on private jets often work solo with more than a dozen passengers. Their jobs are demanding. They are responsible for upholding safety precautions, sourcing meal ingredients, cooking food, cleaning the aircraft and waiting on wealthy clients.\n“We’re not flying the aircraft but we’re doing everything so that these clients can be happy on these aircrafts,” said Ms. Pires, who is also the executive director of VVIP International, a Miami-based company that trains corporate flight attendants and staffs private flights.\nShe said passengers have asked corporate flight attendants to pick up items at Saks Fifth Avenue or to find caviar or pricey bottles of Don Julio 1942 tequila.\nGiven the requirements in the Netflix job description, the company’s new flight attendant would likely need to be experienced and available to work around the clock to get top pay, Ms. Pires said.\nLauren Pires of VVIP International. PHOTO: NICK ECHEVARRIA\nThe bottom end of the posted salary range for the position is $60,000. Netflix likely posted the range to comply with California’s new salary transparency law, which requires most employers to list pay on job postings. New York City and Washington state have similar laws.\nSome employers have posted broad pay ranges to comply with the law, leaving some applicants questioning how useful the requirement is.\nNetflix co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings, who the company said Thursday would transition to executive chairman, has long championed transparency as key to the company’s culture. And the streaming company has historically given employees broader access to corporate information than many publicly traded companies. But it is now restricting the ability of some staff to see other employees’ salary information, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat do you think of pay disclosures in job postings? Join the conversation below.\nChristine Hendrickson, the vice president of strategic initiatives at Syndio Inc., a workplace analytics platform, said companies sometimes post wide salary ranges when they are hiring for positions at different levels or trying to account for applicants from high-cost or low-cost living areas.\nNetflix, for example, has a separate listing for a software engineer who would either work remotely or be based in Silicon Valley. The salary range: between $90,000 and $900,000.\nAdvertisement\nWrite to Alyssa Lukpat at alyssa.lukpat@wsj.com and Suryatapa Bhattacharya at Suryatapa.Bhattacharya@wsj.com\nSHOW CONVERSATION (75)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nFurther Reading\nNetflix and Spotify Are Resilient, but Not Recession-Proof\nBundle of Disney+, Hulu and Max Has a Strong Hold on Viewers.

The employee must have outstanding customer service skills and safety training. The pay range for the role is listed as 60,000 to 385,000, depending on the person's background, according to. Netflix. By comparison, the median flight attendant annual salary in was about 61,000, according to the. U.S. Bureau of. Labor. Statistics. Netflix didn't return requests for comment. The job listing went viral. \"Where do. I apply?!\" was a common refrain. Some social-media users couldn't believe the wide pay range, a likely effect of new pay-transparency disclosure laws enacted recently in several states including. California, where. Netflix is based. Others were surprised. Netflix was advertising the role at all, as the company has been focused on reining in spending. Last year. Netflix posted two consecutive quarters of subscriber losses for the first time in its history and laid off hundreds of employees. But the year ended with what the company called a \"brighter finish,\" as. Netflix beat its own forecast for subscriber gains in the fourth quarter. As interest rates rise and companies tighten their belts, white-collar workers have taken the brunt of layoffs and job cuts, breaking with the usual pattern leading into a downturn. WSJ explains why many professionals are getting the pink slip first. Illustration. Adele. Morgan. For some flight attendants, the biggest surprise was the potential paycheck. Lauren. Pires, a corporate flight attendant based in. Miami, said she has never heard of anyone in her industry who has made 385,000. \"This has to be quite, quite the position to be at this salary,\" said. Ms. Pires, who has worked on private jets for over a decade. She said a lot of corporate flight attendants make six figures but not as much as the maximum pay on the. Netflix listing. The job asks the new hire to balance a highflying life on its. Gulfstream. G550 jet charter trips with the mundane. Netflix's corporate aircraft services are available to some executives and their families and guests for personal use, according to the company. \"Consider amounts related to such travel as a perquisite,\" the company's compensation disclosure says. A private jet trip is a common perk at some big companies, often for security reasons. \"The aviation team helps. Netflix reach the world more efficiently and effectively so the company can continue to create joy around the world,\" according to the job posting, which noted that the recruit will be based near. Netflix's. Silicon. Valley headquarters. The flight attendant should be capable of standing for long periods, helping with loading baggage, purchasing and loading aircraft stock before a trip. The person, who will join a team of attendants, must also be a self-starter \"The flight attendant will need to operate with little direction and a lot of self-motivation,\" according to the job posting. Netflix's corporate aircraft services are available to some executives and their families and guests for personal use. The position would likely not have much job security or scheduling protections, said. Sara. Nelson, the president of the. Association of. Flight. Attendants-CWA, which represents 50,000 flight attendants. Corporate flight attendants sometimes don't know where they are about to fly when they show up to work. Ms. Pires, the corporate flight attendant, said her peers on private jets often work solo with more than a dozen passengers. Their jobs are demanding. They are responsible for upholding safety precautions, sourcing meal ingredients, cooking food, cleaning the aircraft and waiting on wealthy clients. \"We're not flying the aircraft but we're doing everything so that these clients can be happy on these aircrafts,\" said. Ms. Pires, who is also the executive director of. VVIP. International, a. Miami-based company that trains corporate flight attendants and staffs private flights. She said passengers have asked corporate flight attendants to pick up items at. Saks. Fifth. Avenue or to find caviar or pricey bottles of. Don. Julio tequila. Given the requirements in the. Netflix job description, the company's new flight attendant would likely need to be experienced and available to work around the clock to get top pay,. Ms. Pires said. Lauren. Pires of. VVIP. International. The bottom end of the posted salary range for the position is 60,000. Netflix likely posted the range to comply with. California's new salary transparency law, which requires most employers to list pay on job postings. New. York. City and. Washington state have similar laws. Some employers have posted broad pay ranges to comply with the law, leaving some applicants questioning how useful the requirement is. Netflix co-Chief. Executive. Reed. Hastings, who the company said. Thursday would transition to executive chairman, has long championed transparency as key to the company's culture. And the streaming company has historically given employees broader access to corporate information than many publicly traded companies. But it is now restricting the ability of some staff to see other employees' salary information,. The. Wall. Street. Journal reported earlier this month. What do you think of pay disclosures in job postings? Join the conversation below. Christine. Hendrickson, the vice president of strategic initiatives at. Syndio. Inc., a workplace analytics platform, said companies sometimes post wide salary ranges when they are hiring for positions at different levels or trying to account for applicants from high-cost or low-cost living areas. Netflix, for example, has a separate listing for a software engineer who would either work remotely or be based in. Silicon. Valley. The salary range between 90,000 and 900,000. Secret. Purges,.

Tim Kaine of Virginia, pictured Friday in Richmond, was first elected to the Senate in 2012. PHOTO: JOHN C. CLARK/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said he would run for a third term, providing his party a boost ahead of what is expected to be a tough 2024 campaign to keep control of the chamber. \n“I’m a servant, I love Virginia, I’m proud of what I’ve done, and I’ve got a whole lot more I want to do,” he said at a press conference in Richmond, Va. \nMr. Kaine, 64 years old, served as mayor of Richmond, and later as Virginia’s governor. He was first elected to the Senate in 2012 and won re-election in 2018. His profile was elevated in 2016 when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton chose him to be her vice presidential running mate. \nWhile Virginia is considered a competitive state, Mr. Kaine handily won re-election by a 15-point margin in 2018 against Republican Corey Stewart, a former Prince William County executive. Democrat Joe Biden won the presidential race by 10 points in 2020, but the state elected Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Lt. Gov.

Ms. Sears and state Attorney General Jason Miyares could also look at the Senate or governor race. Some House Republicans could pursue statewide office, such as freshman Rep. Jen Kiggans. \nThe Democratic caucus, which includes three independents who align with the party, currently has a 51-49 majority in the Senate. But Democrats are defending far more seats than Republicans in 2024. Earlier this month, Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D., Mich.) said she won’t seek re-election, potentially easing the way for Republicans to flip that seat.\nDemocrats breathed a sigh of relief that Mr. Kaine was running for another term, after he had held off on committing to another run and as he continues to suffer long-term symptoms from Covid-19. He said party leaders encouraged him to run again.\nHe said that despite the split control of Congress, he could see some progress on immigration laws, mental health and addiction.\n“Is it going to be tougher the next couple of years? Yes, it will be,” he said at his press conference. “But are there meaningful things that can be done and done in a bipartisan way? I believe so,” he said.\nMr. Kaine has been a reliable Democratic vote in the Senate. In his announcement, he touted his work on transportation projects such as highway improvements and the Metro Silver Line in Northern Virginia, as well as his work on foreign affairs and helping military families and veterans.\nIn recent months, he opposed efforts by Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) to push through a provision approving the Mountain Valley Pipeline in West Virginia and Virginia as part of his stalled permitting overhaul proposal. He has worked with Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) on compromise legislation that would codify the rights to abortion recognized in the now-defunct 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and related rulings. Mr. Kaine personally opposes abortion but supports abortion access.\nMr. Kaine is a fluent Spanish speaker, and back in 2016 the Clinton campaign hoped he could help mobilize Latino voters. During his first address as running mate, he switched between English and Spanish and described himself as a progressive, reacting to criticism from the party’s left wing that he was a pro-business centrist who was too open to trade deals. \nMr. Kaine also noted his perfect election record. “I’m 8-0 and I promise you I’m not about to let that change,” he said.

PHOTO: CAITLIN O’HARA/REUTERS\nSome of Wall Street’s most speculative investors are scaling back their ambitions, doing deals that are a 10th the size of their flashy, top-of-market acquisitions. \nCreators of special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, are valuing companies they seek to take public at the lowest levels since the boom began nearly three years ago, figures from Dealogic show.
