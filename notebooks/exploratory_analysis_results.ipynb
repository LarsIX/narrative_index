PHOTO: GONZALO FUENTES/REUTERS\nKey Points\nWhat's This?\nKering is set to name Luca de Meo, Renault’s CEO, as chief executive, replacing Francois-Henri Pinault, people familiar with the matter said.\nDe Meo refocused Renault, slimming its model range and boosting profitability in electric vehicles.\nKering’s shares, which have fallen steeply from a peak earlier this decade, rallied on the likely appointment.\nPARIS—François-Henri Pinault, the billionaire heir who spent two decades transforming Kering KER -3.54%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\ninto a luxury powerhouse, is stepping back as chief executive officer, hoping an auto-industry veteran can pull Gucci and Saint Laurent out of a slump.\nKering on Monday named departing Renault chief Luca de Meo as CEO, ending months of speculation about a possible leadership change at the French fashion group, which also owns Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen. \nPinault, who took charge in 2005 from his father, oversaw Kering’s shift from a sprawling retail conglomerate to a focused luxury player. The move paid off handsomely during the boom years, but it has since run into trouble.\nNow, Pinault said, Kering was “ready for a new stage in its development.” He praised de Meo’s “experience at the helm of an international listed group, his sharp understanding of brands, and his sense of a strong and respectful corporate culture.”\nDe Meo will take the helm on Sept. 15, subject to shareholder approval, Kering said. His last day at Renault RNO -0.95%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\nwill be July 15. Pinault will remain chairman.\nFor Kering, the move represents a gamble at a precarious moment. Once a leader in European luxury, the group now lags behind rivals such as Hermès and Bernard Arnault’s LVMH by a widening margin. \nGucci, Kering’s biggest brand by revenue, has stumbled in China and lost ground to many competitors. Saint Laurent has also struggled, weighed down by a smaller wholesale business and a tougher U.S. market. Kering’s market value has dropped about 70% from a high three years ago.\n“De Meo has a titanic challenge ahead of him,” said Luca Solca, analyst at Bernstein. “Investors will need to hear what it is that de Meo plans to do and digest how soon his plans can be realized.”\nKering investors welcomed the news. Kering shares rose 12% in Paris on Monday, after reports of the likely appointment emerged, while Renault stock fell 8%.\nPinault, who met de Meo a few months ago, told analysts he had been laying the groundwork to split the roles of chairman and CEO for a number of years, a process that accelerated in recent months. He brought in two headhunters to help identify a successor.\nIn addition to retaining the chairman’s role, Pinault and his family hold a 42% shareholding and about 60% of the company’s voting rights. The holding accounts for the bulk of the family’s fortune, estimated at just under $20 billion.\nWith the 58-year-old de Meo, Kering is betting that an executive who revitalized car marques can do the same for handbags and ready-to-wear clothes.\nDe Meo has more than three decades of experience in the automotive industry, building a strong reputation as a brand builder and marketer. He helped turn Fiat’s modern 500 into a cultural icon, carved out Seat’s sporty Cupra line, and refocused Renault by slimming its model range and boosting profitability in hybrids and electric vehicles.\nDe Meo is also no stranger to craftsmanship: He collects intricate Swiss watches and counts Pietro Beccari, CEO of LVMH’s Louis Vuitton brand, as a close friend—a bond cemented over regular padel matches.\nStill, running a carmaker and leading a luxury conglomerate demand different skills. Success in autos relies heavily on industrial scale, efficiency and engineering excellence. High fashion, by contrast, depends more on narrative, cultural cachet and the unpredictable chemistry between designers and audiences. A luxury leader must be able to manage a stable of creative directors, handle viral social-media moments and safeguard brand mystique.\nReviving underperforming brands has become more complex and costly, with investors wary of turnaround stories and consumers gravitating toward established leaders, said Thomas Chauvet, luxury analyst at Citi. He said Kering faces a long road to restore momentum at Gucci and Saint Laurent and secure steady growth and cash flow.\nPinault has been candid about the need for bold action and has shaken up Kering over the past two years. He named two deputy CEOs and became more involved in so-called brand-elevation strategies, which aim to ensure that every action taken builds the brand’s long-term standing, in areas from real estate to marketing and product development. \nAt Gucci, which made up almost half of sales and more than 60% of core profit last year, a new CEO took over in the fall.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1513 ET – The latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East, between Israel and Iran, raises the risk of a tighter oil market and higher prices in the near term. But if the conflict ends with a definitive suppression of Iran’s nuclear-weapons capability, it could actually bring more stability to the oil market, Donald Luskin and Michael Warren of Trend Macro write. “We note that all the price action has been in the spot market,” with oil futures moving somewhat less, they observe. “We think markets are telling us that any risks are exclusively in the short term.” Trend maintains a price target of $60 to $80 on benchmark Brent crude. Brent has traded around $72.96 in recent action. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)\n1112 ET – European energy stocks retreat in late afternoon European trade. Shares were up earlier in the session but followed oil lower after Iran signaled it would consider resuming talks over its nuclear program. Oil plunged more than 4% in afternoon trade as fears of a prolonged and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran ease. In London, BP trades down 1.3% while Shell falls 0.3%. France’s TotalEnergies drops 0.8%, Austria’s OMV is down 0.3% and Norway’s Equinor falls 0.1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1050 ET – Crude oil is down 4.6% to back below $70 a barrel. The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1513 ET – The latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East, between Israel and Iran, raises the risk of a tighter oil market and higher prices in the near term. But if the conflict ends with a definitive suppression of Iran’s nuclear-weapons capability, it could actually bring more stability to the oil market, Donald Luskin and Michael Warren of Trend Macro write. “We note that all the price action has been in the spot market,” with oil futures moving somewhat less, they observe. “We think markets are telling us that any risks are exclusively in the short term.” Trend maintains a price target of $60 to $80 on benchmark Brent crude. Brent has traded around $72.96 in recent action. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)\n1112 ET – European energy stocks retreat in late afternoon European trade. Shares were up earlier in the session but followed oil lower after Iran signaled it would consider resuming talks over its nuclear program. Oil plunged more than 4% in afternoon trade as fears of a prolonged and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran ease. In London, BP trades down 1.3% while Shell falls 0.3%. France’s TotalEnergies drops 0.8%, Austria’s OMV is down 0.3% and Norway’s Equinor falls 0.1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1050 ET – Crude oil is down 4.6% to back below $70 a barrel. The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1513 ET – The latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East, between Israel and Iran, raises the risk of a tighter oil market and higher prices in the near term. But if the conflict ends with a definitive suppression of Iran’s nuclear-weapons capability, it could actually bring more stability to the oil market, Donald Luskin and Michael Warren of Trend Macro write. “We note that all the price action has been in the spot market,” with oil futures moving somewhat less, they observe. “We think markets are telling us that any risks are exclusively in the short term.” Trend maintains a price target of $60 to $80 on benchmark Brent crude. Brent has traded around $72.96 in recent action. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)\n1112 ET – European energy stocks retreat in late afternoon European trade. Shares were up earlier in the session but followed oil lower after Iran signaled it would consider resuming talks over its nuclear program. Oil plunged more than 4% in afternoon trade as fears of a prolonged and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran ease. In London, BP trades down 1.3% while Shell falls 0.3%. France’s TotalEnergies drops 0.8%, Austria’s OMV is down 0.3% and Norway’s Equinor falls 0.1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1050 ET – Crude oil is down 4.6% to back below $70 a barrel. The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

But if the conflict ends with a definitive suppression of Iran’s nuclear-weapons capability, it could actually bring more stability to the oil market, Donald Luskin and Michael Warren of Trend Macro write. “We note that all the price action has been in the spot market,” with oil futures moving somewhat less, they observe. “We think markets are telling us that any risks are exclusively in the short term.” Trend maintains a price target of $60 to $80 on benchmark Brent crude. Brent has traded around $72.96 in recent action. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)\n1112 ET – European energy stocks retreat in late afternoon European trade.

The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs.

Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%.

(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums.

The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1513 ET – The latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East, between Israel and Iran, raises the risk of a tighter oil market and higher prices in the near term. But if the conflict ends with a definitive suppression of Iran’s nuclear-weapons capability, it could actually bring more stability to the oil market, Donald Luskin and Michael Warren of Trend Macro write. “We note that all the price action has been in the spot market,” with oil futures moving somewhat less, they observe. “We think markets are telling us that any risks are exclusively in the short term.” Trend maintains a price target of $60 to $80 on benchmark Brent crude. Brent has traded around $72.96 in recent action. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)\n1112 ET – European energy stocks retreat in late afternoon European trade. Shares were up earlier in the session but followed oil lower after Iran signaled it would consider resuming talks over its nuclear program. Oil plunged more than 4% in afternoon trade as fears of a prolonged and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran ease. In London, BP trades down 1.3% while Shell falls 0.3%. France’s TotalEnergies drops 0.8%, Austria’s OMV is down 0.3% and Norway’s Equinor falls 0.1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1050 ET – Crude oil is down 4.6% to back below $70 a barrel. The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%.

(sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds.

(yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1513 ET – The latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East, between Israel and Iran, raises the risk of a tighter oil market and higher prices in the near term. But if the conflict ends with a definitive suppression of Iran’s nuclear-weapons capability, it could actually bring more stability to the oil market, Donald Luskin and Michael Warren of Trend Macro write. “We note that all the price action has been in the spot market,” with oil futures moving somewhat less, they observe. “We think markets are telling us that any risks are exclusively in the short term.” Trend maintains a price target of $60 to $80 on benchmark Brent crude. Brent has traded around $72.96 in recent action. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)\n1112 ET – European energy stocks retreat in late afternoon European trade. Shares were up earlier in the session but followed oil lower after Iran signaled it would consider resuming talks over its nuclear program. Oil plunged more than 4% in afternoon trade as fears of a prolonged and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran ease. In London, BP trades down 1.3% while Shell falls 0.3%. France’s TotalEnergies drops 0.8%, Austria’s OMV is down 0.3% and Norway’s Equinor falls 0.1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1050 ET – Crude oil is down 4.6% to back below $70 a barrel. The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says.

The firm says its most-likely case for gold is that prices consolidate around the $3,100 to $3,500 per troy ounce range in 3Q, before then easing more through the end of the year into 2026. Citi also believes unexpected settlements to ongoing geopolitical crises and sources of uncertainty could sink gold prices earlier than expected. Front-month gold futures settle down 1% to $3,396.40 a troy ounce, snapping a three-session winning streak for gold, but it’s still the fifth-highest close ever. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1116 ET – London-listed gold miners trade down in late-afternoon European trade. Safe-haven demand for gold slipped as Iran signaled it would consider restarting talks over its nuclear program if the U.S. doesn’t join Israel’s attack. Gold futures are down 1.1% at $3,415.60 a troy ounce but the precious metal remains up 1.8% on week. Hochschild Mining shares trade down 5.6% while Endeavour Mining drops 3%. Gold and silver miner Fresnillo falls 1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1031 ET – Dundee Precious Metals’ acquisition of Adriatic Metals was a long-expected move, CIBC’s Cosmos Chiu says. From Dundee’s perspective, Chiu says, sitting on $763 million in cash at the end of 1Q with no debt, but a declining production profile, an acquisition was only a matter of time. Adriatic Metals, with production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, fits in well with Dundee’s other assets in Bulgaria and Serbia, and adds more silver, lead, and zinc to the portfolio, Chiu says. Altogether, he says the acquisition is about 5% accretive to net asset value and about 15% accretive to forward cash flow.(adriano.marchese@wsj.com)\n0604 ET – With Brenntag’s changes at the top levels of management only now in progress, the charting of a new way forward is likely to be a late 2025 factor, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. This risks a cost and free cash flow overhang for the German chemicals company, the analysts say. In addition, “the compressing global chemical production cost curve and lower demand/volume levels suggest risk to short/medium-term earnings progression,” they say. Jefferies cuts its price target to 53.00 euros from 63.00 euros. Shares trade broadly flat at 60.02 euros. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0521 ET – Challenging end markets are likely to overhang Clariant’s earnings development, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. The Swiss chemical company’s net pricing should support relative resilience when compared to its peers, the analysts say. However, its midterm targets appear challenging to meet given the uncertain macro-economy, they say. Jefferies reduces its price target to 9.50 Swiss francs from 10.90 francs, downgrading its recommendation to hold. Shares trade 1.1% lower at 8.36 francs. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0235 ET – Market reactions were surprisingly muted at the start of the week despite a busy weekend of headlines, as Iran-Israel hostilities continued, says Swissquote Bank’s Ipek Ozkardeskaya. U.S. crude and Brent both opened higher but quickly gave back some gains. Natural gas also spiked at the open before retreating, while gold also pared gains as well, the senior analyst says. Some analysts argue that the conflict could ultimately dampen global growth, capping oil’s upside, she writes. Others believe that high prices could encourage shale producers to boost output. “Realistically, the risk of disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz–a critical chokepoint for a third of global oil flows–means the balance of risks remains tilted to the upside.” (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)\n2135 ET – Another leg higher for shares of miners including Anglo American and Freeport mostly depends on commodity prices rising, according to Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina. “That is fine,” he says in a note, “but it can be a short-term problem as geopolitical risks escalate…again.” LaFemina cautions to prepare for some volatility in mining stocks. In Sydney, BHP and Rio Tinto are up 0.5% and 1.2%, respectively. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2115 ET – Dundee’s roughly US$1.3 billion takeover deal with Adriatic Metals looks good for Adriatic shareholders, say Canaccord Genuity analysts Paul Howard and Alex Bedwany. The cash-and-scrip deal is only an 11% premium to Adriatic’s last closing price before the deal was announced, the analysts note. Yet it is a 51% premium to where the stock traded before Adriatic confirmed it was in talks with Dundee. It is a “strong premium if looking at the whole picture,” the analysts say. They reiterate Canaccord’s hold rating and A$5.50 target on Adriatic. The stock is up 9.4% at A$5.47. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2057 ET – Nufarm is reviewing its Seed Technologies business and Bell Potter thinks a sale would be a material catalyst for the stock. It thinks a breakup could realize between A$3.73/share and A$5.16/share in value. Analyst Jonathan Snape says that assessment is based on multiples that he considers to be conservative. “An exit from Seeds would likely highlight a crop protection business trading at a 25-50% discount to peers,” Bell Potter says. It has a buy call and A$3.45/share price target on Nufarm, which is up 4.5% at A$2.34.

The firm says its most-likely case for gold is that prices consolidate around the $3,100 to $3,500 per troy ounce range in 3Q, before then easing more through the end of the year into 2026. Citi also believes unexpected settlements to ongoing geopolitical crises and sources of uncertainty could sink gold prices earlier than expected. Front-month gold futures settle down 1% to $3,396.40 a troy ounce, snapping a three-session winning streak for gold, but it’s still the fifth-highest close ever. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1116 ET – London-listed gold miners trade down in late-afternoon European trade. Safe-haven demand for gold slipped as Iran signaled it would consider restarting talks over its nuclear program if the U.S. doesn’t join Israel’s attack. Gold futures are down 1.1% at $3,415.60 a troy ounce but the precious metal remains up 1.8% on week. Hochschild Mining shares trade down 5.6% while Endeavour Mining drops 3%. Gold and silver miner Fresnillo falls 1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1031 ET – Dundee Precious Metals’ acquisition of Adriatic Metals was a long-expected move, CIBC’s Cosmos Chiu says. From Dundee’s perspective, Chiu says, sitting on $763 million in cash at the end of 1Q with no debt, but a declining production profile, an acquisition was only a matter of time. Adriatic Metals, with production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, fits in well with Dundee’s other assets in Bulgaria and Serbia, and adds more silver, lead, and zinc to the portfolio, Chiu says. Altogether, he says the acquisition is about 5% accretive to net asset value and about 15% accretive to forward cash flow.(adriano.marchese@wsj.com)\n0604 ET – With Brenntag’s changes at the top levels of management only now in progress, the charting of a new way forward is likely to be a late 2025 factor, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. This risks a cost and free cash flow overhang for the German chemicals company, the analysts say. In addition, “the compressing global chemical production cost curve and lower demand/volume levels suggest risk to short/medium-term earnings progression,” they say. Jefferies cuts its price target to 53.00 euros from 63.00 euros. Shares trade broadly flat at 60.02 euros. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0521 ET – Challenging end markets are likely to overhang Clariant’s earnings development, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. The Swiss chemical company’s net pricing should support relative resilience when compared to its peers, the analysts say. However, its midterm targets appear challenging to meet given the uncertain macro-economy, they say. Jefferies reduces its price target to 9.50 Swiss francs from 10.90 francs, downgrading its recommendation to hold. Shares trade 1.1% lower at 8.36 francs. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0235 ET – Market reactions were surprisingly muted at the start of the week despite a busy weekend of headlines, as Iran-Israel hostilities continued, says Swissquote Bank’s Ipek Ozkardeskaya. U.S. crude and Brent both opened higher but quickly gave back some gains. Natural gas also spiked at the open before retreating, while gold also pared gains as well, the senior analyst says. Some analysts argue that the conflict could ultimately dampen global growth, capping oil’s upside, she writes. Others believe that high prices could encourage shale producers to boost output. “Realistically, the risk of disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz–a critical chokepoint for a third of global oil flows–means the balance of risks remains tilted to the upside.” (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)\n2135 ET – Another leg higher for shares of miners including Anglo American and Freeport mostly depends on commodity prices rising, according to Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina. “That is fine,” he says in a note, “but it can be a short-term problem as geopolitical risks escalate…again.” LaFemina cautions to prepare for some volatility in mining stocks.

The firm says its most-likely case for gold is that prices consolidate around the $3,100 to $3,500 per troy ounce range in 3Q, before then easing more through the end of the year into 2026. Citi also believes unexpected settlements to ongoing geopolitical crises and sources of uncertainty could sink gold prices earlier than expected. Front-month gold futures settle down 1% to $3,396.40 a troy ounce, snapping a three-session winning streak for gold, but it’s still the fifth-highest close ever. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1116 ET – London-listed gold miners trade down in late-afternoon European trade. Safe-haven demand for gold slipped as Iran signaled it would consider restarting talks over its nuclear program if the U.S. doesn’t join Israel’s attack. Gold futures are down 1.1% at $3,415.60 a troy ounce but the precious metal remains up 1.8% on week. Hochschild Mining shares trade down 5.6% while Endeavour Mining drops 3%. Gold and silver miner Fresnillo falls 1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1031 ET – Dundee Precious Metals’ acquisition of Adriatic Metals was a long-expected move, CIBC’s Cosmos Chiu says. From Dundee’s perspective, Chiu says, sitting on $763 million in cash at the end of 1Q with no debt, but a declining production profile, an acquisition was only a matter of time. Adriatic Metals, with production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, fits in well with Dundee’s other assets in Bulgaria and Serbia, and adds more silver, lead, and zinc to the portfolio, Chiu says. Altogether, he says the acquisition is about 5% accretive to net asset value and about 15% accretive to forward cash flow.(adriano.marchese@wsj.com)\n0604 ET – With Brenntag’s changes at the top levels of management only now in progress, the charting of a new way forward is likely to be a late 2025 factor, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. This risks a cost and free cash flow overhang for the German chemicals company, the analysts say. In addition, “the compressing global chemical production cost curve and lower demand/volume levels suggest risk to short/medium-term earnings progression,” they say. Jefferies cuts its price target to 53.00 euros from 63.00 euros. Shares trade broadly flat at 60.02 euros. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0521 ET – Challenging end markets are likely to overhang Clariant’s earnings development, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. The Swiss chemical company’s net pricing should support relative resilience when compared to its peers, the analysts say. However, its midterm targets appear challenging to meet given the uncertain macro-economy, they say. Jefferies reduces its price target to 9.50 Swiss francs from 10.90 francs, downgrading its recommendation to hold. Shares trade 1.1% lower at 8.36 francs. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0235 ET – Market reactions were surprisingly muted at the start of the week despite a busy weekend of headlines, as Iran-Israel hostilities continued, says Swissquote Bank’s Ipek Ozkardeskaya. U.S. crude and Brent both opened higher but quickly gave back some gains. Natural gas also spiked at the open before retreating, while gold also pared gains as well, the senior analyst says. Some analysts argue that the conflict could ultimately dampen global growth, capping oil’s upside, she writes. Others believe that high prices could encourage shale producers to boost output. “Realistically, the risk of disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz–a critical chokepoint for a third of global oil flows–means the balance of risks remains tilted to the upside.” (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)\n2135 ET – Another leg higher for shares of miners including Anglo American and Freeport mostly depends on commodity prices rising, according to Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina. “That is fine,” he says in a note, “but it can be a short-term problem as geopolitical risks escalate…again.” LaFemina cautions to prepare for some volatility in mining stocks. In Sydney, BHP and Rio Tinto are up 0.5% and 1.2%, respectively. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2115 ET – Dundee’s roughly US$1.3 billion takeover deal with Adriatic Metals looks good for Adriatic shareholders, say Canaccord Genuity analysts Paul Howard and Alex Bedwany. The cash-and-scrip deal is only an 11% premium to Adriatic’s last closing price before the deal was announced, the analysts note. Yet it is a 51% premium to where the stock traded before Adriatic confirmed it was in talks with Dundee. It is a “strong premium if looking at the whole picture,” the analysts say. They reiterate Canaccord’s hold rating and A$5.50 target on Adriatic. The stock is up 9.4% at A$5.47. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2057 ET – Nufarm is reviewing its Seed Technologies business and Bell Potter thinks a sale would be a material catalyst for the stock. It thinks a breakup could realize between A$3.73/share and A$5.16/share in value. Analyst Jonathan Snape says that assessment is based on multiples that he considers to be conservative. “An exit from Seeds would likely highlight a crop protection business trading at a 25-50% discount to peers,” Bell Potter says.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1422 ET – Citi Research says gold prices may have found their top, with prices expected to ease in the third quarter of 2025. The firm says its most-likely case for gold is that prices consolidate around the $3,100 to $3,500 per troy ounce range in 3Q, before then easing more through the end of the year into 2026. Citi also believes unexpected settlements to ongoing geopolitical crises and sources of uncertainty could sink gold prices earlier than expected. Front-month gold futures settle down 1% to $3,396.40 a troy ounce, snapping a three-session winning streak for gold, but it’s still the fifth-highest close ever. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1116 ET – London-listed gold miners trade down in late-afternoon European trade. Safe-haven demand for gold slipped as Iran signaled it would consider restarting talks over its nuclear program if the U.S. doesn’t join Israel’s attack. Gold futures are down 1.1% at $3,415.60 a troy ounce but the precious metal remains up 1.8% on week. Hochschild Mining shares trade down 5.6% while Endeavour Mining drops 3%. Gold and silver miner Fresnillo falls 1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1031 ET – Dundee Precious Metals’ acquisition of Adriatic Metals was a long-expected move, CIBC’s Cosmos Chiu says. From Dundee’s perspective, Chiu says, sitting on $763 million in cash at the end of 1Q with no debt, but a declining production profile, an acquisition was only a matter of time. Adriatic Metals, with production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, fits in well with Dundee’s other assets in Bulgaria and Serbia, and adds more silver, lead, and zinc to the portfolio, Chiu says. Altogether, he says the acquisition is about 5% accretive to net asset value and about 15% accretive to forward cash flow.(adriano.marchese@wsj.com)\n0604 ET – With Brenntag’s changes at the top levels of management only now in progress, the charting of a new way forward is likely to be a late 2025 factor, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. This risks a cost and free cash flow overhang for the German chemicals company, the analysts say. In addition, “the compressing global chemical production cost curve and lower demand/volume levels suggest risk to short/medium-term earnings progression,” they say. Jefferies cuts its price target to 53.00 euros from 63.00 euros. Shares trade broadly flat at 60.02 euros. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0521 ET – Challenging end markets are likely to overhang Clariant’s earnings development, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. The Swiss chemical company’s net pricing should support relative resilience when compared to its peers, the analysts say. However, its midterm targets appear challenging to meet given the uncertain macro-economy, they say.

The firm says its most-likely case for gold is that prices consolidate around the $3,100 to $3,500 per troy ounce range in 3Q, before then easing more through the end of the year into 2026. Citi also believes unexpected settlements to ongoing geopolitical crises and sources of uncertainty could sink gold prices earlier than expected. Front-month gold futures settle down 1% to $3,396.40 a troy ounce, snapping a three-session winning streak for gold, but it’s still the fifth-highest close ever. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1116 ET – London-listed gold miners trade down in late-afternoon European trade. Safe-haven demand for gold slipped as Iran signaled it would consider restarting talks over its nuclear program if the U.S. doesn’t join Israel’s attack. Gold futures are down 1.1% at $3,415.60 a troy ounce but the precious metal remains up 1.8% on week. Hochschild Mining shares trade down 5.6% while Endeavour Mining drops 3%. Gold and silver miner Fresnillo falls 1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1031 ET – Dundee Precious Metals’ acquisition of Adriatic Metals was a long-expected move, CIBC’s Cosmos Chiu says. From Dundee’s perspective, Chiu says, sitting on $763 million in cash at the end of 1Q with no debt, but a declining production profile, an acquisition was only a matter of time. Adriatic Metals, with production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, fits in well with Dundee’s other assets in Bulgaria and Serbia, and adds more silver, lead, and zinc to the portfolio, Chiu says. Altogether, he says the acquisition is about 5% accretive to net asset value and about 15% accretive to forward cash flow.(adriano.marchese@wsj.com)\n0604 ET – With Brenntag’s changes at the top levels of management only now in progress, the charting of a new way forward is likely to be a late 2025 factor, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. This risks a cost and free cash flow overhang for the German chemicals company, the analysts say. In addition, “the compressing global chemical production cost curve and lower demand/volume levels suggest risk to short/medium-term earnings progression,” they say. Jefferies cuts its price target to 53.00 euros from 63.00 euros. Shares trade broadly flat at 60.02 euros. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0521 ET – Challenging end markets are likely to overhang Clariant’s earnings development, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. The Swiss chemical company’s net pricing should support relative resilience when compared to its peers, the analysts say. However, its midterm targets appear challenging to meet given the uncertain macro-economy, they say. Jefferies reduces its price target to 9.50 Swiss francs from 10.90 francs, downgrading its recommendation to hold. Shares trade 1.1% lower at 8.36 francs. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0235 ET – Market reactions were surprisingly muted at the start of the week despite a busy weekend of headlines, as Iran-Israel hostilities continued, says Swissquote Bank’s Ipek Ozkardeskaya. U.S. crude and Brent both opened higher but quickly gave back some gains. Natural gas also spiked at the open before retreating, while gold also pared gains as well, the senior analyst says. Some analysts argue that the conflict could ultimately dampen global growth, capping oil’s upside, she writes. Others believe that high prices could encourage shale producers to boost output. “Realistically, the risk of disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz–a critical chokepoint for a third of global oil flows–means the balance of risks remains tilted to the upside.” (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)\n2135 ET – Another leg higher for shares of miners including Anglo American and Freeport mostly depends on commodity prices rising, according to Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina. “That is fine,” he says in a note, “but it can be a short-term problem as geopolitical risks escalate…again.” LaFemina cautions to prepare for some volatility in mining stocks. In Sydney, BHP and Rio Tinto are up 0.5% and 1.2%, respectively. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2115 ET – Dundee’s roughly US$1.3 billion takeover deal with Adriatic Metals looks good for Adriatic shareholders, say Canaccord Genuity analysts Paul Howard and Alex Bedwany. The cash-and-scrip deal is only an 11% premium to Adriatic’s last closing price before the deal was announced, the analysts note. Yet it is a 51% premium to where the stock traded before Adriatic confirmed it was in talks with Dundee. It is a “strong premium if looking at the whole picture,” the analysts say. They reiterate Canaccord’s hold rating and A$5.50 target on Adriatic. The stock is up 9.4% at A$5.47. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2057 ET – Nufarm is reviewing its Seed Technologies business and Bell Potter thinks a sale would be a material catalyst for the stock. It thinks a breakup could realize between A$3.73/share and A$5.16/share in value. Analyst Jonathan Snape says that assessment is based on multiples that he considers to be conservative. “An exit from Seeds would likely highlight a crop protection business trading at a 25-50% discount to peers,” Bell Potter says.

         "BUSINESS\nAuto & Transport Roundup: Market Talk\nUpdated June 16, 2025 5:06 pm ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(9 min)\nPHOTO: BILL PUGLIANO/GETTY IMAGES\nThe latest Market Talks covering the Auto and Transport sector. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n0841 ET – Renault’s CEO Luca de Meo will leave the company next month, and his enthusiasm will be missed, Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois writes. The bank credits him for bringing back energy and peak results to Renault after years of subpar product and financials. Besides a transferable understanding of brands from his work at other automakers, he had considerable impact on staff morale when he joined, Jefferies says. “His departure leaves Renault leaderless at a time when the group is due to communicate a new strategic plan and further unwind the Nissan Alliance.” Recent management changes at Stellantis might provide a pool of applicants, Houchois adds. Shares fall 6.8%. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)\n0612 ET – Kering would likely benefit from Luca De Meo’s track record in turning around a French company if he is named CEO, RBC Capital Markets analysts Piral Dadhania and Richard Chamberlain write in a note. The luxury group is reportedly poised to appoint De Meo to the top job, after French carmaker Renault said he plans to step down as CEO in mid-July. Francois Henri-Pinault currently holds the combined position of chairman and CEO at Kering. The role is likely to be split in two, with Pinault remaining chairman and De Meo taking over as CEO. Kering has struggled to stabilize the business in recent years, the analysts say. The move signals intent to improve executive leadership capabilities and governance, they add. Shares are 9.8% higher at 189.78 euros. (andrea.figueras@wsj.com)\n0356 ET – Oil prices edge higher in early trade, adding to last week’s surge as Israel and Iran exchange strikes for a fourth day. Brent crude gains 0.2% to $74.40 a barrel, while WTI advances 0.4% to $73.23 a barrel. “The nature of the attacks by both sides over the weekend suggests risks to the oil market have escalated,” ANZ Research says. Strikes targeting Iran’s energy infrastructure–including fuel depots and a major oil refinery–have heightened concerns for global energy markets. But the greatest worry is the potential disruption of flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a vital shipping chokepoint. “The main issue the market will have to watch for is whether Iran’s retaliation broadens outside of Israel to disrupt oil flows in the Persian Gulf’s Strait of Hormuz,” according to ANZ. “Over 17 million b/d of oil supply transiting the Strait would be at risk.” (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)\n0259 ET – The departure of Renault’s CEO ahead of a reported move to lead Kering will likely be viewed positively by investors in the luxury group in the near term, Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet writes. De Meo is perceived to have contributed significantly to Renault’s turnaround through product refreshes, technological innovation, an EV transition, brand elevation, and a return to growth and profit, Chauvet says. However, the execution of luxury-brand turnarounds has become more complex, lengthy, costly and far less public-market friendly in the past few years, he adds. There is still considerable work ahead for Kering’s Gucci and Saint Laurent brands, which together account for around 80% of the group’s EBIT. A successful turnaround could lead to multiple re-ratings, the bank says. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)\n0211 ET – Renault Chief Executive Luca de Meo is stepping down and is reportedly set to join Kering, which would be a positive move for the French luxury group, Bernstein analysts write. Kering needs change, as performance has continued to deteriorate, and there has been a sense that more experience and gravitas in senior management would be appropriate, the bank adds. Luca de Meo comes with a strong track record of success in different automotive companies. As well as devising and leading Renault’s strategic plan that transformed its fortunes, Renault now has some of the most credible answers among legacy automakers to the threat posed by Chinese battery electric vehicle challengers, it adds. “Brand management and marketing are his forte, which dovetails with what the luxury industry does.” (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2344 ET – WICE Logistics is poised for strong 2Q earnings thanks to an order windfall stemming from the 90-day pause on “reciprocal” U.S. tariffs, Thanachart Securities’ Rata Limsuthiwanpoom says in a research report. The freight forwarder had a 15% revenue exposure to the U.S. in 2024. The Thai company is also set to benefit from the improvement in its subsidiary ETL’s cross-border cold chain business, driven by effective cost management and the benefits of high operating leverage. The brokerage raises the stock’s target price to THB2.60 from THB2.30. However, it retains a sell rating, citing the stock’s expensive valuation. Shares are 2.65% lower at THB2.94. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)\n2258 ET – Westports is set for near-term earnings growth following a staggered 30% tariff hike at Port Klang, CIMB Securities analyst Mohd Shanaz Noor Azam says in a note. The tariff revision appears earnings-accretive, as container segment contribute 85.5% of Westports’s 2024 revenue, with gateway containers–45% of total throughput volume–driving most of the uplift. Transshipment gains will be more gradual due to existing agreements with shipping liners delaying tariff pass-through, he adds. The analystraises Westports’s 2025-2027 EPS forecasts by 8%-22%, noting that higher tariffs will fund expansion and offset cost pressures. CIMB lifts its target price to MYR5.10 from MYR4.50, while keeping a hold rating. Shares are 6.0% higher at MYR4.95. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2233 ET – SIA Engineering’s growth trajectory continues to look favorable, OCBC Investment Research’s Ada Lim says in a research report. The International Air Transport Association said in early June that aircraft backlog exceeds 17,000, with implied wait time of 14 years for deliveries. The aircraft shortage means more airlines must fly older planes, the analyst says. SIA Engineering looks well-placed to capitalize on likely rapid growth of maintenance, repair and overhaul services for such planes in Asia-Pacific, given 70.4% of its FY 2025 revenue came from East Asia. OCBC raises the stock’s fair value estimate to S$3.50 from S$3.00 with an unchanged buy rating. Shares are 2.3% higher at S$3.15.

         "BUSINESS\nGucci Owner Picks Auto Executive for One of Global Luxury’s Top Jobs\nRenault’s Luca de Meo faces a ‘titanic challenge’ at Kering, analyst says\nBy\nNick Kostov\nFollow\nUpdated June 16, 2025 12:51 pm ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(5 min)\nLuca de Meo has led Renault for five years. PHOTO: GONZALO FUENTES/REUTERS\nKey Points\nWhat's This?\nKering is set to name Luca de Meo, Renault’s CEO, as chief executive, replacing Francois-Henri Pinault, people familiar with the matter said.\nDe Meo refocused Renault, slimming its model range and boosting profitability in electric vehicles.\nKering’s shares, which have fallen steeply from a peak earlier this decade, rallied on the likely appointment.\nPARIS—François-Henri Pinault, the billionaire heir who spent two decades transforming Kering KER -3.54%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\ninto a luxury powerhouse, is stepping back as chief executive officer, hoping an auto-industry veteran can pull Gucci and Saint Laurent out of a slump.\nKering on Monday named departing Renault chief Luca de Meo as CEO, ending months of speculation about a possible leadership change at the French fashion group, which also owns Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen. \nPinault, who took charge in 2005 from his father, oversaw Kering’s shift from a sprawling retail conglomerate to a focused luxury player. The move paid off handsomely during the boom years, but it has since run into trouble.\nNow, Pinault said, Kering was “ready for a new stage in its development.” He praised de Meo’s “experience at the helm of an international listed group, his sharp understanding of brands, and his sense of a strong and respectful corporate culture.”\nDe Meo will take the helm on Sept. 15, subject to shareholder approval, Kering said. His last day at Renault RNO -0.95%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\nwill be July 15. Pinault will remain chairman.\nFor Kering, the move represents a gamble at a precarious moment. Once a leader in European luxury, the group now lags behind rivals such as Hermès and Bernard Arnault’s LVMH by a widening margin. \nGucci, Kering’s biggest brand by revenue, has stumbled in China and lost ground to many competitors. Saint Laurent has also struggled, weighed down by a smaller wholesale business and a tougher U.S. market. Kering’s market value has dropped about 70% from a high three years ago.\n“De Meo has a titanic challenge ahead of him,” said Luca Solca, analyst at Bernstein. “Investors will need to hear what it is that de Meo plans to do and digest how soon his plans can be realized.”\nKering investors welcomed the news. Kering shares rose 12% in Paris on Monday, after reports of the likely appointment emerged, while Renault stock fell 8%.\nPinault, who met de Meo a few months ago, told analysts he had been laying the groundwork to split the roles of chairman and CEO for a number of years, a process that accelerated in recent months. He brought in two headhunters to help identify a successor.\nIn addition to retaining the chairman’s role, Pinault and his family hold a 42% shareholding and about 60% of the company’s voting rights. The holding accounts for the bulk of the family’s fortune, estimated at just under $20 billion.\nWith the 58-year-old de Meo, Kering is betting that an executive who revitalized car marques can do the same for handbags and ready-to-wear clothes.\nDe Meo has more than three decades of experience in the automotive industry, building a strong reputation as a brand builder and marketer. He helped turn Fiat’s modern 500 into a cultural icon, carved out Seat’s sporty Cupra line, and refocused Renault by slimming its model range and boosting profitability in hybrids and electric vehicles.\nDe Meo is also no stranger to craftsmanship: He collects intricate Swiss watches and counts Pietro Beccari, CEO of LVMH’s Louis Vuitton brand, as a close friend—a bond cemented over regular padel matches.\nStill, running a carmaker and leading a luxury conglomerate demand different skills. Success in autos relies heavily on industrial scale, efficiency and engineering excellence. High fashion, by contrast, depends more on narrative, cultural cachet and the unpredictable chemistry between designers and audiences. A luxury leader must be able to manage a stable of creative directors, handle viral social-media moments and safeguard brand mystique.\nReviving underperforming brands has become more complex and costly, with investors wary of turnaround stories and consumers gravitating toward established leaders, said Thomas Chauvet, luxury analyst at Citi. He said Kering faces a long road to restore momentum at Gucci and Saint Laurent and secure steady growth and cash flow.\nPinault has been candid about the need for bold action and has shaken up Kering over the past two years. He named two deputy CEOs and became more involved in so-called brand-elevation strategies, which aim to ensure that every action taken builds the brand’s long-term standing, in areas from real estate to marketing and product development. \nAt Gucci, which made up almost half of sales and more than 60% of core profit last year, a new CEO took over in the fall. A new creative director, Demna Gvasalia of Balenciaga, is due to take over the creative reins in July.\nWrite to Nick Kostov at nick.kostov@dowjones.com\nAppeared in the June 17, 2025, print edition as 'Kering Taps Renault for Next CEO'.\nVideos\nMost Popular News\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Discharged After Hospitalization\nIsrael Built Its Case for War With Iran on New Intelligence.

         "5 min. Luca de. Meo has led. Renault for five years. What's. This? Kering is set to name. Luca de. Meo,. Renault's. CEO, as chief executive, replacing. Francois-Henri. Pinault, people familiar with the matter said. into a luxury powerhouse, is stepping back as chief executive officer, hoping an auto-industry veteran can pull. Gucci and. Saint. Laurent out of a slump. Kering on. Monday named departing. Renault chief. Luca de. Meo as. CEO, ending months of speculation about a possible leadership change at the. French fashion group, which also owns. Bottega. Veneta,. Balenciaga and. Alexander. McQueen. Pinault, who took charge in from his father, oversaw. Kering's shift from a sprawling retail conglomerate to a focused luxury player. The move paid off handsomely during the boom years, but it has since run into trouble. Now,. Pinault said,. Kering was \"ready for a new stage in its development.\". He praised de. Meo's \"experience at the helm of an international listed group, his sharp understanding of brands, and his sense of a strong and respectful corporate culture.\". De. Meo will take the helm on. Sept. 15, subject to shareholder approval,. Kering said. His last day at. Renault. RNO -0.95. For. Kering, the move represents a gamble at a precarious moment. Once a leader in. European luxury, the group now lags behind rivals such as. Herms and. Bernard. Arnault's. LVMH by a widening margin. Gucci,. Kering's biggest brand by revenue, has stumbled in. China and lost ground to many competitors. Saint. Laurent has also struggled, weighed down by a smaller wholesale business and a tougher. U.S. market. Kering's market value has dropped about 70 from a high three years ago. \"De. Meo has a titanic challenge ahead of him,\" said. Luca. Solca, analyst at. Bernstein. \"Investors will need to hear what it is that de. Meo plans to do and digest how soon his plans can be realized.\". Kering investors welcomed the news. Kering shares rose 12 in. Paris on. Monday, after reports of the likely appointment emerged, while. Renault stock fell 8. Pinault, who met de. Meo a few months ago, told analysts he had been laying the groundwork to split the roles of chairman and. CEO for a number of years, a process that accelerated in recent months. He brought in two headhunters to help identify a successor. In addition to retaining the chairman's role,. Pinault and his family hold a 42 shareholding and about 60 of the company's voting rights. The holding accounts for the bulk of the family's fortune, estimated at just under 20 billion. With the 58-year-old de. Meo,. Kering is betting that an executive who revitalized car marques can do the same for handbags and ready-to-wear clothes. De. Meo has more than three decades of experience in the automotive industry, building a strong reputation as a brand builder and marketer. He helped turn. Fiat's modern 500 into a cultural icon, carved out. Seat's sporty. Cupra line, and refocused. Renault model range and boosting profitability in hybrids and electric vehicles. De. Meo is also no stranger to craftsmanship. He collects intricate. Swiss watches and counts. Pietro. Beccari,. CEO of. LVMH's. Louis. Vuitton brand, as a close frienda bond cemented over regular padel matches. Still, running a carmaker and leading a luxury conglomerate demand different skills. Success in autos relies heavily on industrial scale, efficiency and engineering excellence. High fashion, by contrast, depends more on narrative, cultural cachet and the unpredictable chemistry between designers and audiences. A luxury leader must be able to manage a stable of creative directors, handle viral social-media moments and safeguard brand mystique. Reviving underperforming brands has become more complex and costly, with investors wary of turnaround stories and consumers gravitating toward established leaders, said. Thomas. Chauvet, luxury analyst at. Citi. He said. Kering faces a long road to restore momentum at. Gucci and. Saint. Laurent and secure steady growth and cash flow. Pinault has been candid about the need for bold action and has shaken up. Kering over the past two years. He named two deputy. CEOs and became more involved in so-called brand-elevation strategies, which aim to ensure that every action taken builds the brand's long-term standing, in areas from real estate to marketing and product development. At. Gucci, which made up almost half of sales and more than 60 of core profit last year, a new. CEO took over in the fall. A new creative director,. Demna. Gvasalia of. Balenciaga, is due to take over the creative reins in. July. Iran. Is. Trump's. Deterrence. Moment. At. MIT and. Yale, 'Graduation's. Ruined'. Trump vs. Israel vs. Iran. May 19,",

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1513 ET – The latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East, between Israel and Iran, raises the risk of a tighter oil market and higher prices in the near term. But if the conflict ends with a definitive suppression of Iran’s nuclear-weapons capability, it could actually bring more stability to the oil market, Donald Luskin and Michael Warren of Trend Macro write. “We note that all the price action has been in the spot market,” with oil futures moving somewhat less, they observe. “We think markets are telling us that any risks are exclusively in the short term.” Trend maintains a price target of $60 to $80 on benchmark Brent crude. Brent has traded around $72.96 in recent action. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)\n1112 ET – European energy stocks retreat in late afternoon European trade. Shares were up earlier in the session but followed oil lower after Iran signaled it would consider resuming talks over its nuclear program. Oil plunged more than 4% in afternoon trade as fears of a prolonged and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran ease. In London, BP trades down 1.3% while Shell falls 0.3%. France’s TotalEnergies drops 0.8%, Austria’s OMV is down 0.3% and Norway’s Equinor falls 0.1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1050 ET – Crude oil is down 4.6% to back below $70 a barrel. The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1513 ET – The latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East, between Israel and Iran, raises the risk of a tighter oil market and higher prices in the near term. But if the conflict ends with a definitive suppression of Iran’s nuclear-weapons capability, it could actually bring more stability to the oil market, Donald Luskin and Michael Warren of Trend Macro write. “We note that all the price action has been in the spot market,” with oil futures moving somewhat less, they observe. “We think markets are telling us that any risks are exclusively in the short term.” Trend maintains a price target of $60 to $80 on benchmark Brent crude. Brent has traded around $72.96 in recent action. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)\n1112 ET – European energy stocks retreat in late afternoon European trade. Shares were up earlier in the session but followed oil lower after Iran signaled it would consider resuming talks over its nuclear program. Oil plunged more than 4% in afternoon trade as fears of a prolonged and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran ease. In London, BP trades down 1.3% while Shell falls 0.3%. France’s TotalEnergies drops 0.8%, Austria’s OMV is down 0.3% and Norway’s Equinor falls 0.1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1050 ET – Crude oil is down 4.6% to back below $70 a barrel. The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13.

(yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1513 ET – The latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East, between Israel and Iran, raises the risk of a tighter oil market and higher prices in the near term. But if the conflict ends with a definitive suppression of Iran’s nuclear-weapons capability, it could actually bring more stability to the oil market, Donald Luskin and Michael Warren of Trend Macro write. “We note that all the price action has been in the spot market,” with oil futures moving somewhat less, they observe. “We think markets are telling us that any risks are exclusively in the short term.” Trend maintains a price target of $60 to $80 on benchmark Brent crude. Brent has traded around $72.96 in recent action. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)\n1112 ET – European energy stocks retreat in late afternoon European trade. Shares were up earlier in the session but followed oil lower after Iran signaled it would consider resuming talks over its nuclear program. Oil plunged more than 4% in afternoon trade as fears of a prolonged and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran ease. In London, BP trades down 1.3% while Shell falls 0.3%. France’s TotalEnergies drops 0.8%, Austria’s OMV is down 0.3% and Norway’s Equinor falls 0.1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1050 ET – Crude oil is down 4.6% to back below $70 a barrel. The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1513 ET – The latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East, between Israel and Iran, raises the risk of a tighter oil market and higher prices in the near term. But if the conflict ends with a definitive suppression of Iran’s nuclear-weapons capability, it could actually bring more stability to the oil market, Donald Luskin and Michael Warren of Trend Macro write. “We note that all the price action has been in the spot market,” with oil futures moving somewhat less, they observe. “We think markets are telling us that any risks are exclusively in the short term.” Trend maintains a price target of $60 to $80 on benchmark Brent crude. Brent has traded around $72.96 in recent action. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)\n1112 ET – European energy stocks retreat in late afternoon European trade. Shares were up earlier in the session but followed oil lower after Iran signaled it would consider resuming talks over its nuclear program. Oil plunged more than 4% in afternoon trade as fears of a prolonged and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran ease. In London, BP trades down 1.3% while Shell falls 0.3%. France’s TotalEnergies drops 0.8%, Austria’s OMV is down 0.3% and Norway’s Equinor falls 0.1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1050 ET – Crude oil is down 4.6% to back below $70 a barrel. The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

But if the conflict ends with a definitive suppression of Iran’s nuclear-weapons capability, it could actually bring more stability to the oil market, Donald Luskin and Michael Warren of Trend Macro write. “We note that all the price action has been in the spot market,” with oil futures moving somewhat less, they observe. “We think markets are telling us that any risks are exclusively in the short term.” Trend maintains a price target of $60 to $80 on benchmark Brent crude. Brent has traded around $72.96 in recent action. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)\n1112 ET – European energy stocks retreat in late afternoon European trade. Shares were up earlier in the session but followed oil lower after Iran signaled it would consider resuming talks over its nuclear program.

The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs.

Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

The firm says its most-likely case for gold is that prices consolidate around the $3,100 to $3,500 per troy ounce range in 3Q, before then easing more through the end of the year into 2026. Citi also believes unexpected settlements to ongoing geopolitical crises and sources of uncertainty could sink gold prices earlier than expected. Front-month gold futures settle down 1% to $3,396.40 a troy ounce, snapping a three-session winning streak for gold, but it’s still the fifth-highest close ever. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1116 ET – London-listed gold miners trade down in late-afternoon European trade. Safe-haven demand for gold slipped as Iran signaled it would consider restarting talks over its nuclear program if the U.S. doesn’t join Israel’s attack. Gold futures are down 1.1% at $3,415.60 a troy ounce but the precious metal remains up 1.8% on week. Hochschild Mining shares trade down 5.6% while Endeavour Mining drops 3%. Gold and silver miner Fresnillo falls 1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1031 ET – Dundee Precious Metals’ acquisition of Adriatic Metals was a long-expected move, CIBC’s Cosmos Chiu says. From Dundee’s perspective, Chiu says, sitting on $763 million in cash at the end of 1Q with no debt, but a declining production profile, an acquisition was only a matter of time. Adriatic Metals, with production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, fits in well with Dundee’s other assets in Bulgaria and Serbia, and adds more silver, lead, and zinc to the portfolio, Chiu says. Altogether, he says the acquisition is about 5% accretive to net asset value and about 15% accretive to forward cash flow.(adriano.marchese@wsj.com)\n0604 ET – With Brenntag’s changes at the top levels of management only now in progress, the charting of a new way forward is likely to be a late 2025 factor, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. This risks a cost and free cash flow overhang for the German chemicals company, the analysts say. In addition, “the compressing global chemical production cost curve and lower demand/volume levels suggest risk to short/medium-term earnings progression,” they say. Jefferies cuts its price target to 53.00 euros from 63.00 euros. Shares trade broadly flat at 60.02 euros. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0521 ET – Challenging end markets are likely to overhang Clariant’s earnings development, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. The Swiss chemical company’s net pricing should support relative resilience when compared to its peers, the analysts say. However, its midterm targets appear challenging to meet given the uncertain macro-economy, they say. Jefferies reduces its price target to 9.50 Swiss francs from 10.90 francs, downgrading its recommendation to hold. Shares trade 1.1% lower at 8.36 francs. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0235 ET – Market reactions were surprisingly muted at the start of the week despite a busy weekend of headlines, as Iran-Israel hostilities continued, says Swissquote Bank’s Ipek Ozkardeskaya. U.S. crude and Brent both opened higher but quickly gave back some gains. Natural gas also spiked at the open before retreating, while gold also pared gains as well, the senior analyst says. Some analysts argue that the conflict could ultimately dampen global growth, capping oil’s upside, she writes. Others believe that high prices could encourage shale producers to boost output. “Realistically, the risk of disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz–a critical chokepoint for a third of global oil flows–means the balance of risks remains tilted to the upside.” (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)\n2135 ET – Another leg higher for shares of miners including Anglo American and Freeport mostly depends on commodity prices rising, according to Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina. “That is fine,” he says in a note, “but it can be a short-term problem as geopolitical risks escalate…again.” LaFemina cautions to prepare for some volatility in mining stocks. In Sydney, BHP and Rio Tinto are up 0.5% and 1.2%, respectively. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2115 ET – Dundee’s roughly US$1.3 billion takeover deal with Adriatic Metals looks good for Adriatic shareholders, say Canaccord Genuity analysts Paul Howard and Alex Bedwany. The cash-and-scrip deal is only an 11% premium to Adriatic’s last closing price before the deal was announced, the analysts note. Yet it is a 51% premium to where the stock traded before Adriatic confirmed it was in talks with Dundee. It is a “strong premium if looking at the whole picture,” the analysts say. They reiterate Canaccord’s hold rating and A$5.50 target on Adriatic. The stock is up 9.4% at A$5.47. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2057 ET – Nufarm is reviewing its Seed Technologies business and Bell Potter thinks a sale would be a material catalyst for the stock. It thinks a breakup could realize between A$3.73/share and A$5.16/share in value. Analyst Jonathan Snape says that assessment is based on multiples that he considers to be conservative. “An exit from Seeds would likely highlight a crop protection business trading at a 25-50% discount to peers,” Bell Potter says.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1422 ET – Citi Research says gold prices may have found their top, with prices expected to ease in the third quarter of 2025. The firm says its most-likely case for gold is that prices consolidate around the $3,100 to $3,500 per troy ounce range in 3Q, before then easing more through the end of the year into 2026. Citi also believes unexpected settlements to ongoing geopolitical crises and sources of uncertainty could sink gold prices earlier than expected. Front-month gold futures settle down 1% to $3,396.40 a troy ounce, snapping a three-session winning streak for gold, but it’s still the fifth-highest close ever. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1116 ET – London-listed gold miners trade down in late-afternoon European trade. Safe-haven demand for gold slipped as Iran signaled it would consider restarting talks over its nuclear program if the U.S. doesn’t join Israel’s attack. Gold futures are down 1.1% at $3,415.60 a troy ounce but the precious metal remains up 1.8% on week. Hochschild Mining shares trade down 5.6% while Endeavour Mining drops 3%. Gold and silver miner Fresnillo falls 1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1031 ET – Dundee Precious Metals’ acquisition of Adriatic Metals was a long-expected move, CIBC’s Cosmos Chiu says. From Dundee’s perspective, Chiu says, sitting on $763 million in cash at the end of 1Q with no debt, but a declining production profile, an acquisition was only a matter of time. Adriatic Metals, with production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, fits in well with Dundee’s other assets in Bulgaria and Serbia, and adds more silver, lead, and zinc to the portfolio, Chiu says. Altogether, he says the acquisition is about 5% accretive to net asset value and about 15% accretive to forward cash flow.(adriano.marchese@wsj.com)\n0604 ET – With Brenntag’s changes at the top levels of management only now in progress, the charting of a new way forward is likely to be a late 2025 factor, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. This risks a cost and free cash flow overhang for the German chemicals company, the analysts say. In addition, “the compressing global chemical production cost curve and lower demand/volume levels suggest risk to short/medium-term earnings progression,” they say. Jefferies cuts its price target to 53.00 euros from 63.00 euros. Shares trade broadly flat at 60.02 euros. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0521 ET – Challenging end markets are likely to overhang Clariant’s earnings development, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. The Swiss chemical company’s net pricing should support relative resilience when compared to its peers, the analysts say. However, its midterm targets appear challenging to meet given the uncertain macro-economy, they say. Jefferies reduces its price target to 9.50 Swiss francs from 10.90 francs, downgrading its recommendation to hold. Shares trade 1.1% lower at 8.36 francs. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0235 ET – Market reactions were surprisingly muted at the start of the week despite a busy weekend of headlines, as Iran-Israel hostilities continued, says Swissquote Bank’s Ipek Ozkardeskaya.

The firm says its most-likely case for gold is that prices consolidate around the $3,100 to $3,500 per troy ounce range in 3Q, before then easing more through the end of the year into 2026. Citi also believes unexpected settlements to ongoing geopolitical crises and sources of uncertainty could sink gold prices earlier than expected. Front-month gold futures settle down 1% to $3,396.40 a troy ounce, snapping a three-session winning streak for gold, but it’s still the fifth-highest close ever. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1116 ET – London-listed gold miners trade down in late-afternoon European trade. Safe-haven demand for gold slipped as Iran signaled it would consider restarting talks over its nuclear program if the U.S. doesn’t join Israel’s attack. Gold futures are down 1.1% at $3,415.60 a troy ounce but the precious metal remains up 1.8% on week. Hochschild Mining shares trade down 5.6% while Endeavour Mining drops 3%. Gold and silver miner Fresnillo falls 1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1031 ET – Dundee Precious Metals’ acquisition of Adriatic Metals was a long-expected move, CIBC’s Cosmos Chiu says. From Dundee’s perspective, Chiu says, sitting on $763 million in cash at the end of 1Q with no debt, but a declining production profile, an acquisition was only a matter of time. Adriatic Metals, with production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, fits in well with Dundee’s other assets in Bulgaria and Serbia, and adds more silver, lead, and zinc to the portfolio, Chiu says. Altogether, he says the acquisition is about 5% accretive to net asset value and about 15% accretive to forward cash flow.(adriano.marchese@wsj.com)\n0604 ET – With Brenntag’s changes at the top levels of management only now in progress, the charting of a new way forward is likely to be a late 2025 factor, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. This risks a cost and free cash flow overhang for the German chemicals company, the analysts say. In addition, “the compressing global chemical production cost curve and lower demand/volume levels suggest risk to short/medium-term earnings progression,” they say. Jefferies cuts its price target to 53.00 euros from 63.00 euros. Shares trade broadly flat at 60.02 euros. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0521 ET – Challenging end markets are likely to overhang Clariant’s earnings development, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. The Swiss chemical company’s net pricing should support relative resilience when compared to its peers, the analysts say. However, its midterm targets appear challenging to meet given the uncertain macro-economy, they say. Jefferies reduces its price target to 9.50 Swiss francs from 10.90 francs, downgrading its recommendation to hold. Shares trade 1.1% lower at 8.36 francs. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0235 ET – Market reactions were surprisingly muted at the start of the week despite a busy weekend of headlines, as Iran-Israel hostilities continued, says Swissquote Bank’s Ipek Ozkardeskaya. U.S. crude and Brent both opened higher but quickly gave back some gains. Natural gas also spiked at the open before retreating, while gold also pared gains as well, the senior analyst says. Some analysts argue that the conflict could ultimately dampen global growth, capping oil’s upside, she writes. Others believe that high prices could encourage shale producers to boost output. “Realistically, the risk of disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz–a critical chokepoint for a third of global oil flows–means the balance of risks remains tilted to the upside.” (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)\n2135 ET – Another leg higher for shares of miners including Anglo American and Freeport mostly depends on commodity prices rising, according to Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina. “That is fine,” he says in a note, “but it can be a short-term problem as geopolitical risks escalate…again.” LaFemina cautions to prepare for some volatility in mining stocks. In Sydney, BHP and Rio Tinto are up 0.5% and 1.2%, respectively. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2115 ET – Dundee’s roughly US$1.3 billion takeover deal with Adriatic Metals looks good for Adriatic shareholders, say Canaccord Genuity analysts Paul Howard and Alex Bedwany. The cash-and-scrip deal is only an 11% premium to Adriatic’s last closing price before the deal was announced, the analysts note. Yet it is a 51% premium to where the stock traded before Adriatic confirmed it was in talks with Dundee. It is a “strong premium if looking at the whole picture,” the analysts say. They reiterate Canaccord’s hold rating and A$5.50 target on Adriatic. The stock is up 9.4% at A$5.47. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2057 ET – Nufarm is reviewing its Seed Technologies business and Bell Potter thinks a sale would be a material catalyst for the stock. It thinks a breakup could realize between A$3.73/share and A$5.16/share in value. Analyst Jonathan Snape says that assessment is based on multiples that he considers to be conservative. “An exit from Seeds would likely highlight a crop protection business trading at a 25-50% discount to peers,” Bell Potter says. It has a buy call and A$3.45/share price target on Nufarm, which is up 4.5% at A$2.34.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n0841 ET – Renault’s CEO Luca de Meo will leave the company next month, and his enthusiasm will be missed, Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois writes. The bank credits him for bringing back energy and peak results to Renault after years of subpar product and financials. Besides a transferable understanding of brands from his work at other automakers, he had considerable impact on staff morale when he joined, Jefferies says. “His departure leaves Renault leaderless at a time when the group is due to communicate a new strategic plan and further unwind the Nissan Alliance.” Recent management changes at Stellantis might provide a pool of applicants, Houchois adds. Shares fall 6.8%. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)\n0612 ET – Kering would likely benefit from Luca De Meo’s track record in turning around a French company if he is named CEO, RBC Capital Markets analysts Piral Dadhania and Richard Chamberlain write in a note. The luxury group is reportedly poised to appoint De Meo to the top job, after French carmaker Renault said he plans to step down as CEO in mid-July. Francois Henri-Pinault currently holds the combined position of chairman and CEO at Kering. The role is likely to be split in two, with Pinault remaining chairman and De Meo taking over as CEO. Kering has struggled to stabilize the business in recent years, the analysts say. The move signals intent to improve executive leadership capabilities and governance, they add. Shares are 9.8% higher at 189.78 euros. (andrea.figueras@wsj.com)\n0356 ET – Oil prices edge higher in early trade, adding to last week’s surge as Israel and Iran exchange strikes for a fourth day. Brent crude gains 0.2% to $74.40 a barrel, while WTI advances 0.4% to $73.23 a barrel. “The nature of the attacks by both sides over the weekend suggests risks to the oil market have escalated,” ANZ Research says. Strikes targeting Iran’s energy infrastructure–including fuel depots and a major oil refinery–have heightened concerns for global energy markets. But the greatest worry is the potential disruption of flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a vital shipping chokepoint. “The main issue the market will have to watch for is whether Iran’s retaliation broadens outside of Israel to disrupt oil flows in the Persian Gulf’s Strait of Hormuz,” according to ANZ. “Over 17 million b/d of oil supply transiting the Strait would be at risk.” (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)\n0259 ET – The departure of Renault’s CEO ahead of a reported move to lead Kering will likely be viewed positively by investors in the luxury group in the near term, Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet writes. De Meo is perceived to have contributed significantly to Renault’s turnaround through product refreshes, technological innovation, an EV transition, brand elevation, and a return to growth and profit, Chauvet says. However, the execution of luxury-brand turnarounds has become more complex, lengthy, costly and far less public-market friendly in the past few years, he adds. There is still considerable work ahead for Kering’s Gucci and Saint Laurent brands, which together account for around 80% of the group’s EBIT. A successful turnaround could lead to multiple re-ratings, the bank says. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)\n0211 ET – Renault Chief Executive Luca de Meo is stepping down and is reportedly set to join Kering, which would be a positive move for the French luxury group, Bernstein analysts write. Kering needs change, as performance has continued to deteriorate, and there has been a sense that more experience and gravitas in senior management would be appropriate, the bank adds. Luca de Meo comes with a strong track record of success in different automotive companies. As well as devising and leading Renault’s strategic plan that transformed its fortunes, Renault now has some of the most credible answers among legacy automakers to the threat posed by Chinese battery electric vehicle challengers, it adds. “Brand management and marketing are his forte, which dovetails with what the luxury industry does.” (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2344 ET – WICE Logistics is poised for strong 2Q earnings thanks to an order windfall stemming from the 90-day pause on “reciprocal” U.S. tariffs, Thanachart Securities’ Rata Limsuthiwanpoom says in a research report. The freight forwarder had a 15% revenue exposure to the U.S. in 2024. The Thai company is also set to benefit from the improvement in its subsidiary ETL’s cross-border cold chain business, driven by effective cost management and the benefits of high operating leverage. The brokerage raises the stock’s target price to THB2.60 from THB2.30. However, it retains a sell rating, citing the stock’s expensive valuation. Shares are 2.65% lower at THB2.94. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)\n2258 ET – Westports is set for near-term earnings growth following a staggered 30% tariff hike at Port Klang, CIMB Securities analyst Mohd Shanaz Noor Azam says in a note. The tariff revision appears earnings-accretive, as container segment contribute 85.5% of Westports’s 2024 revenue, with gateway containers–45% of total throughput volume–driving most of the uplift. Transshipment gains will be more gradual due to existing agreements with shipping liners delaying tariff pass-through, he adds. The analystraises Westports’s 2025-2027 EPS forecasts by 8%-22%, noting that higher tariffs will fund expansion and offset cost pressures. CIMB lifts its target price to MYR5.10 from MYR4.50, while keeping a hold rating. Shares are 6.0% higher at MYR4.95. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2233 ET – SIA Engineering’s growth trajectory continues to look favorable, OCBC Investment Research’s Ada Lim says in a research report. The International Air Transport Association said in early June that aircraft backlog exceeds 17,000, with implied wait time of 14 years for deliveries. The aircraft shortage means more airlines must fly older planes, the analyst says. SIA Engineering looks well-placed to capitalize on likely rapid growth of maintenance, repair and overhaul services for such planes in Asia-Pacific, given 70.4% of its FY 2025 revenue came from East Asia. OCBC raises the stock’s fair value estimate to S$3.50 from S$3.00 with an unchanged buy rating. Shares are 2.3% higher at S$3.15.

         "BUSINESS\nGucci Owner Picks Auto Executive for One of Global Luxury’s Top Jobs\nRenault’s Luca de Meo faces a ‘titanic challenge’ at Kering, analyst says\nBy\nNick Kostov\nFollow\nUpdated June 16, 2025 12:51 pm ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(5 min)\nLuca de Meo has led Renault for five years. PHOTO: GONZALO FUENTES/REUTERS\nKey Points\nWhat's This?\nKering is set to name Luca de Meo, Renault’s CEO, as chief executive, replacing Francois-Henri Pinault, people familiar with the matter said.\nDe Meo refocused Renault, slimming its model range and boosting profitability in electric vehicles.\nKering’s shares, which have fallen steeply from a peak earlier this decade, rallied on the likely appointment.\nPARIS—François-Henri Pinault, the billionaire heir who spent two decades transforming Kering KER -3.54%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\ninto a luxury powerhouse, is stepping back as chief executive officer, hoping an auto-industry veteran can pull Gucci and Saint Laurent out of a slump.\nKering on Monday named departing Renault chief Luca de Meo as CEO, ending months of speculation about a possible leadership change at the French fashion group, which also owns Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen. \nPinault, who took charge in 2005 from his father, oversaw Kering’s shift from a sprawling retail conglomerate to a focused luxury player. The move paid off handsomely during the boom years, but it has since run into trouble.\nNow, Pinault said, Kering was “ready for a new stage in its development.” He praised de Meo’s “experience at the helm of an international listed group, his sharp understanding of brands, and his sense of a strong and respectful corporate culture.”\nDe Meo will take the helm on Sept. 15, subject to shareholder approval, Kering said. His last day at Renault RNO -0.95%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\nwill be July 15. Pinault will remain chairman.\nFor Kering, the move represents a gamble at a precarious moment. Once a leader in European luxury, the group now lags behind rivals such as Hermès and Bernard Arnault’s LVMH by a widening margin. \nGucci, Kering’s biggest brand by revenue, has stumbled in China and lost ground to many competitors. Saint Laurent has also struggled, weighed down by a smaller wholesale business and a tougher U.S. market. Kering’s market value has dropped about 70% from a high three years ago.\n“De Meo has a titanic challenge ahead of him,” said Luca Solca, analyst at Bernstein. “Investors will need to hear what it is that de Meo plans to do and digest how soon his plans can be realized.”\nKering investors welcomed the news. Kering shares rose 12% in Paris on Monday, after reports of the likely appointment emerged, while Renault stock fell 8%.\nPinault, who met de Meo a few months ago, told analysts he had been laying the groundwork to split the roles of chairman and CEO for a number of years, a process that accelerated in recent months. He brought in two headhunters to help identify a successor.\nIn addition to retaining the chairman’s role, Pinault and his family hold a 42% shareholding and about 60% of the company’s voting rights. The holding accounts for the bulk of the family’s fortune, estimated at just under $20 billion.\nWith the 58-year-old de Meo, Kering is betting that an executive who revitalized car marques can do the same for handbags and ready-to-wear clothes.\nDe Meo has more than three decades of experience in the automotive industry, building a strong reputation as a brand builder and marketer. He helped turn Fiat’s modern 500 into a cultural icon, carved out Seat’s sporty Cupra line, and refocused Renault by slimming its model range and boosting profitability in hybrids and electric vehicles.\nDe Meo is also no stranger to craftsmanship: He collects intricate Swiss watches and counts Pietro Beccari, CEO of LVMH’s Louis Vuitton brand, as a close friend—a bond cemented over regular padel matches.\nStill, running a carmaker and leading a luxury conglomerate demand different skills. Success in autos relies heavily on industrial scale, efficiency and engineering excellence. High fashion, by contrast, depends more on narrative, cultural cachet and the unpredictable chemistry between designers and audiences. A luxury leader must be able to manage a stable of creative directors, handle viral social-media moments and safeguard brand mystique.\nReviving underperforming brands has become more complex and costly, with investors wary of turnaround stories and consumers gravitating toward established leaders, said Thomas Chauvet, luxury analyst at Citi.

         "5 min. Luca de. Meo has led. Renault for five years. What's. This? Kering is set to name. Luca de. Meo,. Renault's. CEO, as chief executive, replacing. Francois-Henri. Pinault, people familiar with the matter said. into a luxury powerhouse, is stepping back as chief executive officer, hoping an auto-industry veteran can pull. Gucci and. Saint. Laurent out of a slump. Kering on. Monday named departing. Renault chief. Luca de. Meo as. CEO, ending months of speculation about a possible leadership change at the. French fashion group, which also owns. Bottega. Veneta,. Balenciaga and. Alexander. McQueen. Pinault, who took charge in from his father, oversaw. Kering's shift from a sprawling retail conglomerate to a focused luxury player. The move paid off handsomely during the boom years, but it has since run into trouble. Now,. Pinault said,. Kering was \"ready for a new stage in its development.\". He praised de. Meo's \"experience at the helm of an international listed group, his sharp understanding of brands, and his sense of a strong and respectful corporate culture.\". De. Meo will take the helm on. Sept. 15, subject to shareholder approval,. Kering said. His last day at. Renault. RNO -0.95. For. Kering, the move represents a gamble at a precarious moment. Once a leader in. European luxury, the group now lags behind rivals such as. Herms and. Bernard. Arnault's. LVMH by a widening margin. Gucci,. Kering's biggest brand by revenue, has stumbled in. China and lost ground to many competitors. Saint. Laurent has also struggled, weighed down by a smaller wholesale business and a tougher. U.S. market. Kering's market value has dropped about 70 from a high three years ago. \"De. Meo has a titanic challenge ahead of him,\" said. Luca. Solca, analyst at. Bernstein. \"Investors will need to hear what it is that de. Meo plans to do and digest how soon his plans can be realized.\". Kering investors welcomed the news. Kering shares rose 12 in. Paris on. Monday, after reports of the likely appointment emerged, while. Renault stock fell 8. Pinault, who met de. Meo a few months ago, told analysts he had been laying the groundwork to split the roles of chairman and. CEO for a number of years, a process that accelerated in recent months. He brought in two headhunters to help identify a successor. In addition to retaining the chairman's role,. Pinault and his family hold a 42 shareholding and about 60 of the company's voting rights. The holding accounts for the bulk of the family's fortune, estimated at just under 20 billion. With the 58-year-old de. Meo,. Kering is betting that an executive who revitalized car marques can do the same for handbags and ready-to-wear clothes. De. Meo has more than three decades of experience in the automotive industry, building a strong reputation as a brand builder and marketer. He helped turn. Fiat's modern 500 into a cultural icon, carved out. Seat's sporty. Cupra line, and refocused. Renault model range and boosting profitability in hybrids and electric vehicles. De. Meo is also no stranger to craftsmanship. He collects intricate. Swiss watches and counts. Pietro. Beccari,. CEO of. LVMH's. Louis. Vuitton brand, as a close frienda bond cemented over regular padel matches. Still, running a carmaker and leading a luxury conglomerate demand different skills. Success in autos relies heavily on industrial scale, efficiency and engineering excellence. High fashion, by contrast, depends more on narrative, cultural cachet and the unpredictable chemistry between designers and audiences. A luxury leader must be able to manage a stable of creative directors, handle viral social-media moments and safeguard brand mystique. Reviving underperforming brands has become more complex and costly, with investors wary of turnaround stories and consumers gravitating toward established leaders, said. Thomas. Chauvet, luxury analyst at. Citi. He said. Kering faces a long road to restore momentum at. Gucci and. Saint. Laurent and secure steady growth and cash flow. Pinault has been candid about the need for bold action and has shaken up. Kering over the past two years. He named two deputy. CEOs and became more involved in so-called brand-elevation strategies, which aim to ensure that every action taken builds the brand's long-term standing, in areas from real estate to marketing and product development. At. Gucci, which made up almost half of sales and more than 60 of core profit last year, a new. CEO took over in the fall. A new creative director,. Demna. Gvasalia of.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1513 ET – The latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East, between Israel and Iran, raises the risk of a tighter oil market and higher prices in the near term. But if the conflict ends with a definitive suppression of Iran’s nuclear-weapons capability, it could actually bring more stability to the oil market, Donald Luskin and Michael Warren of Trend Macro write. “We note that all the price action has been in the spot market,” with oil futures moving somewhat less, they observe. “We think markets are telling us that any risks are exclusively in the short term.” Trend maintains a price target of $60 to $80 on benchmark Brent crude. Brent has traded around $72.96 in recent action. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)\n1112 ET – European energy stocks retreat in late afternoon European trade. Shares were up earlier in the session but followed oil lower after Iran signaled it would consider resuming talks over its nuclear program. Oil plunged more than 4% in afternoon trade as fears of a prolonged and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran ease. In London, BP trades down 1.3% while Shell falls 0.3%. France’s TotalEnergies drops 0.8%, Austria’s OMV is down 0.3% and Norway’s Equinor falls 0.1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1050 ET – Crude oil is down 4.6% to back below $70 a barrel. The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

(yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl.

Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1513 ET – The latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East, between Israel and Iran, raises the risk of a tighter oil market and higher prices in the near term. But if the conflict ends with a definitive suppression of Iran’s nuclear-weapons capability, it could actually bring more stability to the oil market, Donald Luskin and Michael Warren of Trend Macro write. “We note that all the price action has been in the spot market,” with oil futures moving somewhat less, they observe. “We think markets are telling us that any risks are exclusively in the short term.” Trend maintains a price target of $60 to $80 on benchmark Brent crude. Brent has traded around $72.96 in recent action. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)\n1112 ET – European energy stocks retreat in late afternoon European trade. Shares were up earlier in the session but followed oil lower after Iran signaled it would consider resuming talks over its nuclear program. Oil plunged more than 4% in afternoon trade as fears of a prolonged and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran ease. In London, BP trades down 1.3% while Shell falls 0.3%. France’s TotalEnergies drops 0.8%, Austria’s OMV is down 0.3% and Norway’s Equinor falls 0.1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1050 ET – Crude oil is down 4.6% to back below $70 a barrel. The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%.

There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1513 ET – The latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East, between Israel and Iran, raises the risk of a tighter oil market and higher prices in the near term. But if the conflict ends with a definitive suppression of Iran’s nuclear-weapons capability, it could actually bring more stability to the oil market, Donald Luskin and Michael Warren of Trend Macro write. “We note that all the price action has been in the spot market,” with oil futures moving somewhat less, they observe. “We think markets are telling us that any risks are exclusively in the short term.” Trend maintains a price target of $60 to $80 on benchmark Brent crude. Brent has traded around $72.96 in recent action. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)\n1112 ET – European energy stocks retreat in late afternoon European trade. Shares were up earlier in the session but followed oil lower after Iran signaled it would consider resuming talks over its nuclear program. Oil plunged more than 4% in afternoon trade as fears of a prolonged and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran ease. In London, BP trades down 1.3% while Shell falls 0.3%. France’s TotalEnergies drops 0.8%, Austria’s OMV is down 0.3% and Norway’s Equinor falls 0.1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1050 ET – Crude oil is down 4.6% to back below $70 a barrel. The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64.

Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks.

Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1513 ET – The latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East, between Israel and Iran, raises the risk of a tighter oil market and higher prices in the near term. But if the conflict ends with a definitive suppression of Iran’s nuclear-weapons capability, it could actually bring more stability to the oil market, Donald Luskin and Michael Warren of Trend Macro write. “We note that all the price action has been in the spot market,” with oil futures moving somewhat less, they observe. “We think markets are telling us that any risks are exclusively in the short term.” Trend maintains a price target of $60 to $80 on benchmark Brent crude. Brent has traded around $72.96 in recent action. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman)\n1112 ET – European energy stocks retreat in late afternoon European trade. Shares were up earlier in the session but followed oil lower after Iran signaled it would consider resuming talks over its nuclear program. Oil plunged more than 4% in afternoon trade as fears of a prolonged and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran ease. In London, BP trades down 1.3% while Shell falls 0.3%. France’s TotalEnergies drops 0.8%, Austria’s OMV is down 0.3% and Norway’s Equinor falls 0.1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1050 ET – Crude oil is down 4.6% to back below $70 a barrel. The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

The drop comes after Iranian leaders say they seek to negotiate to de-escalate hostilities between itself and Israel. WSJ says Tehran has indicated to Arab officials they would be open to returning to the negotiating table as long as the U.S. doesn’t join Israel in its offensive. The possibility of a quick end to the exchange of missile fire is pressuring crude oil, with the most-active contract sinking after Friday’s 7% surge. Brent crude is also lower, while natural gas remains up 2.1%.(kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1038 ET – The dollar weakens as WSJ reports that Iran is signaling it wants to end hostilities with Israel and resume talks over its nuclear programs. Israel’s dominance of Iran’s airspace means Tel Aviv has little incentive to halt the assault before further damage to Iranian nuclear sites, WSJ reports. The news revives risk-taking in financial markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 94.56, on pace for its lowest close since February 2023, extending early declines. Oil benchmarks are sharply down. The greenback falls 0.7% against the euro and 0.2% versus the yen. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0919 ET – Crude oil prices are pulling back after a run-up in the wake of missiles being exchanged between Israel and Iran over the weekend. “While geopolitical tensions support prices, weaker demand signals, such as declining Chinese refinery throughput, pose downside risks,” says Terence Hove of Exness in a note. Crude oil is down 1.5% to $71.89 a barrel. Brent crude is off 1.4% to $73.18 a barrel. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n0847 ET – Treasury yields rise to start a shortened week amid rising tensions in the Middle East and ahead of a Fed meeting widely expected to keep rates on hold. The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

The attacks in Israel and Iran raise fears of a spike in energy prices, which could impact inflation and give the Fed an added reason to stay put this week and in July. Markets are mostly pricing a cut in September. A New York Fed manufacturing survey shows continuing decline in activity in the state in June. The 10-year yield is at 4.435% and the two-year at 3.971%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n0333 ET – European oil stocks rise in initial trade in Europe as oil prices tick up. Brent crude is 0.6% higher at $74.66 a barrel. Investors appear to believe that there won’t be further supply side shocks for oil, XTB research director Kathleen Brooks writes. However, oil prices could have room to rise if the Middle East conflict escalates, Brooks says. In London, BP trades up 1.4% while Shell rises 1.3%. France’s TotalEnergies rises 0.8%, Italy’s Eni is up 1.1%, while Spain’s Repsol climbs 2%. Portugal’s Galp rises 0.6%. (adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2356 ET – The Middle East tensions are unlikely to have a lasting impact on markets unless they cause an oil shock, OCBC analyst Vasu Menon says in a research note. A key worry for markets is how Iran could target one of the world’s most vital oil arteries– the Strait of Hormuz, he says. However, it’s unlikely that Iran will do something this drastic, as it could cause a backlash from its largest oil customer and trading partner, China, the analyst says. The Iranian regime will also be wary of dragging a superpower like the U.S. into its conflict with Israel, he adds. There could be more volatility in the coming days, but what may matter more is the U.S. decision on reciprocal tariffs due by July 9, he adds. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)\n2303 ET – Dialog’s new production-sharing contract with Petronas for the Mutiara Cluster in the Malaysian state of Sabah signals its upstream expansion, Maybank Investment Bank analyst Jeremie Yap says in a note. While further upstream ventures may add earnings volatility from production risks and oil-price swings, near-term impact is likely neutral, given a two-year pre-development phase with minimal capital expenditure of about $2 million, he says. Dialog’s key growth driver remains securing new tank-terminal contracts. Dialog is well positioned to win projects from Pengerang, including ChemOne’s Pengerang Energy Complex, and Petronas’s 6 billion ringgit biorefinery with Eni and Euglena, he adds. Maybank maintains a buy rating on Dialog with an unchanged target price of MYR2.34. Shares are 4.5% higher at MYR1.64. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2256 ET – Oil prices are likely to be supported by tensions in the Middle East, says Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva in a commentary. Crude oil prices surged over 18% in June, driven by consistent demand and increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the analyst points out. Iran holds 3% of global oil supplies. Still, the oil market cannot ignore the potential negative impact that Trump’s universal tariffs may have on economic growth, she adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 1.1% at $73.81/bbl; front-month Brent crude futures are 1.0% higher at $74.94/bbl. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)\n2221 ET – Malaysia’s oil and gas sector may see a short-term re-rating as rising Middle East tensions push Brent crude higher, Hong Leong IB analyst Brian Chin says in a note. Sustained Brent prices above $70/bbl could lift Malaysia’s upstream and service-related names. While long-term fundamentals remain unchanged, Chin sees compelling risk-reward in select stocks such as Dayang, Velesto Energy and Deleum trading at undemanding valuations and offering attractive dividend yields. Hong Leong upgrades the sector to tactical overweight from neutral, and names Dialog Group, Dayang Enterprise, and Deleum as its top picks. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2058 ET – S-Oil is expected to report an operating loss in 2Q, NH Investment & Securities analyst Y.K. Choi writes in a note. Average oil prices remain sharply lower than the previous quarter despite a June spike fueled by geopolitical tensions. It would be inevitable for the South Korean refiner’s loss in the value of its crude-oil inventory to widen, Choi says. The firm’s petrochemical segment is also expected to remain in the red due to weaker aromatics spreads. Still, he expects S-Oil to turn around in 3Q on strong refining margins. NH raises the stock’s target price by 16% to KRW78,000 and keeps its buy rating. Shares are 1.9% lower at KRW62,500.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1422 ET – Citi Research says gold prices may have found their top, with prices expected to ease in the third quarter of 2025. The firm says its most-likely case for gold is that prices consolidate around the $3,100 to $3,500 per troy ounce range in 3Q, before then easing more through the end of the year into 2026. Citi also believes unexpected settlements to ongoing geopolitical crises and sources of uncertainty could sink gold prices earlier than expected. Front-month gold futures settle down 1% to $3,396.40 a troy ounce, snapping a three-session winning streak for gold, but it’s still the fifth-highest close ever. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1116 ET – London-listed gold miners trade down in late-afternoon European trade. Safe-haven demand for gold slipped as Iran signaled it would consider restarting talks over its nuclear program if the U.S. doesn’t join Israel’s attack. Gold futures are down 1.1% at $3,415.60 a troy ounce but the precious metal remains up 1.8% on week. Hochschild Mining shares trade down 5.6% while Endeavour Mining drops 3%. Gold and silver miner Fresnillo falls 1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1031 ET – Dundee Precious Metals’ acquisition of Adriatic Metals was a long-expected move, CIBC’s Cosmos Chiu says. From Dundee’s perspective, Chiu says, sitting on $763 million in cash at the end of 1Q with no debt, but a declining production profile, an acquisition was only a matter of time. Adriatic Metals, with production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, fits in well with Dundee’s other assets in Bulgaria and Serbia, and adds more silver, lead, and zinc to the portfolio, Chiu says. Altogether, he says the acquisition is about 5% accretive to net asset value and about 15% accretive to forward cash flow.(adriano.marchese@wsj.com)\n0604 ET – With Brenntag’s changes at the top levels of management only now in progress, the charting of a new way forward is likely to be a late 2025 factor, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. This risks a cost and free cash flow overhang for the German chemicals company, the analysts say. In addition, “the compressing global chemical production cost curve and lower demand/volume levels suggest risk to short/medium-term earnings progression,” they say. Jefferies cuts its price target to 53.00 euros from 63.00 euros. Shares trade broadly flat at 60.02 euros. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0521 ET – Challenging end markets are likely to overhang Clariant’s earnings development, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. The Swiss chemical company’s net pricing should support relative resilience when compared to its peers, the analysts say. However, its midterm targets appear challenging to meet given the uncertain macro-economy, they say. Jefferies reduces its price target to 9.50 Swiss francs from 10.90 francs, downgrading its recommendation to hold. Shares trade 1.1% lower at 8.36 francs. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0235 ET – Market reactions were surprisingly muted at the start of the week despite a busy weekend of headlines, as Iran-Israel hostilities continued, says Swissquote Bank’s Ipek Ozkardeskaya. U.S. crude and Brent both opened higher but quickly gave back some gains. Natural gas also spiked at the open before retreating, while gold also pared gains as well, the senior analyst says. Some analysts argue that the conflict could ultimately dampen global growth, capping oil’s upside, she writes. Others believe that high prices could encourage shale producers to boost output. “Realistically, the risk of disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz–a critical chokepoint for a third of global oil flows–means the balance of risks remains tilted to the upside.” (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)\n2135 ET – Another leg higher for shares of miners including Anglo American and Freeport mostly depends on commodity prices rising, according to Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina. “That is fine,” he says in a note, “but it can be a short-term problem as geopolitical risks escalate…again.” LaFemina cautions to prepare for some volatility in mining stocks. In Sydney, BHP and Rio Tinto are up 0.5% and 1.2%, respectively. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2115 ET – Dundee’s roughly US$1.3 billion takeover deal with Adriatic Metals looks good for Adriatic shareholders, say Canaccord Genuity analysts Paul Howard and Alex Bedwany. The cash-and-scrip deal is only an 11% premium to Adriatic’s last closing price before the deal was announced, the analysts note. Yet it is a 51% premium to where the stock traded before Adriatic confirmed it was in talks with Dundee. It is a “strong premium if looking at the whole picture,” the analysts say. They reiterate Canaccord’s hold rating and A$5.50 target on Adriatic. The stock is up 9.4% at A$5.47. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2057 ET – Nufarm is reviewing its Seed Technologies business and Bell Potter thinks a sale would be a material catalyst for the stock. It thinks a breakup could realize between A$3.73/share and A$5.16/share in value. Analyst Jonathan Snape says that assessment is based on multiples that he considers to be conservative. “An exit from Seeds would likely highlight a crop protection business trading at a 25-50% discount to peers,” Bell Potter says.

The firm says its most-likely case for gold is that prices consolidate around the $3,100 to $3,500 per troy ounce range in 3Q, before then easing more through the end of the year into 2026. Citi also believes unexpected settlements to ongoing geopolitical crises and sources of uncertainty could sink gold prices earlier than expected. Front-month gold futures settle down 1% to $3,396.40 a troy ounce, snapping a three-session winning streak for gold, but it’s still the fifth-highest close ever. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1116 ET – London-listed gold miners trade down in late-afternoon European trade. Safe-haven demand for gold slipped as Iran signaled it would consider restarting talks over its nuclear program if the U.S. doesn’t join Israel’s attack. Gold futures are down 1.1% at $3,415.60 a troy ounce but the precious metal remains up 1.8% on week. Hochschild Mining shares trade down 5.6% while Endeavour Mining drops 3%. Gold and silver miner Fresnillo falls 1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1031 ET – Dundee Precious Metals’ acquisition of Adriatic Metals was a long-expected move, CIBC’s Cosmos Chiu says. From Dundee’s perspective, Chiu says, sitting on $763 million in cash at the end of 1Q with no debt, but a declining production profile, an acquisition was only a matter of time. Adriatic Metals, with production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, fits in well with Dundee’s other assets in Bulgaria and Serbia, and adds more silver, lead, and zinc to the portfolio, Chiu says. Altogether, he says the acquisition is about 5% accretive to net asset value and about 15% accretive to forward cash flow.(adriano.marchese@wsj.com)\n0604 ET – With Brenntag’s changes at the top levels of management only now in progress, the charting of a new way forward is likely to be a late 2025 factor, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. This risks a cost and free cash flow overhang for the German chemicals company, the analysts say. In addition, “the compressing global chemical production cost curve and lower demand/volume levels suggest risk to short/medium-term earnings progression,” they say. Jefferies cuts its price target to 53.00 euros from 63.00 euros. Shares trade broadly flat at 60.02 euros. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0521 ET – Challenging end markets are likely to overhang Clariant’s earnings development, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. The Swiss chemical company’s net pricing should support relative resilience when compared to its peers, the analysts say. However, its midterm targets appear challenging to meet given the uncertain macro-economy, they say. Jefferies reduces its price target to 9.50 Swiss francs from 10.90 francs, downgrading its recommendation to hold. Shares trade 1.1% lower at 8.36 francs. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0235 ET – Market reactions were surprisingly muted at the start of the week despite a busy weekend of headlines, as Iran-Israel hostilities continued, says Swissquote Bank’s Ipek Ozkardeskaya. U.S. crude and Brent both opened higher but quickly gave back some gains. Natural gas also spiked at the open before retreating, while gold also pared gains as well, the senior analyst says. Some analysts argue that the conflict could ultimately dampen global growth, capping oil’s upside, she writes. Others believe that high prices could encourage shale producers to boost output. “Realistically, the risk of disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz–a critical chokepoint for a third of global oil flows–means the balance of risks remains tilted to the upside.” (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)\n2135 ET – Another leg higher for shares of miners including Anglo American and Freeport mostly depends on commodity prices rising, according to Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina. “That is fine,” he says in a note, “but it can be a short-term problem as geopolitical risks escalate…again.” LaFemina cautions to prepare for some volatility in mining stocks. In Sydney, BHP and Rio Tinto are up 0.5% and 1.2%, respectively. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2115 ET – Dundee’s roughly US$1.3 billion takeover deal with Adriatic Metals looks good for Adriatic shareholders, say Canaccord Genuity analysts Paul Howard and Alex Bedwany. The cash-and-scrip deal is only an 11% premium to Adriatic’s last closing price before the deal was announced, the analysts note. Yet it is a 51% premium to where the stock traded before Adriatic confirmed it was in talks with Dundee. It is a “strong premium if looking at the whole picture,” the analysts say. They reiterate Canaccord’s hold rating and A$5.50 target on Adriatic. The stock is up 9.4% at A$5.47. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2057 ET – Nufarm is reviewing its Seed Technologies business and Bell Potter thinks a sale would be a material catalyst for the stock. It thinks a breakup could realize between A$3.73/share and A$5.16/share in value. Analyst Jonathan Snape says that assessment is based on multiples that he considers to be conservative. “An exit from Seeds would likely highlight a crop protection business trading at a 25-50% discount to peers,” Bell Potter says.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n1422 ET – Citi Research says gold prices may have found their top, with prices expected to ease in the third quarter of 2025. The firm says its most-likely case for gold is that prices consolidate around the $3,100 to $3,500 per troy ounce range in 3Q, before then easing more through the end of the year into 2026. Citi also believes unexpected settlements to ongoing geopolitical crises and sources of uncertainty could sink gold prices earlier than expected. Front-month gold futures settle down 1% to $3,396.40 a troy ounce, snapping a three-session winning streak for gold, but it’s still the fifth-highest close ever. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1116 ET – London-listed gold miners trade down in late-afternoon European trade. Safe-haven demand for gold slipped as Iran signaled it would consider restarting talks over its nuclear program if the U.S. doesn’t join Israel’s attack. Gold futures are down 1.1% at $3,415.60 a troy ounce but the precious metal remains up 1.8% on week. Hochschild Mining shares trade down 5.6% while Endeavour Mining drops 3%. Gold and silver miner Fresnillo falls 1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1031 ET – Dundee Precious Metals’ acquisition of Adriatic Metals was a long-expected move, CIBC’s Cosmos Chiu says. From Dundee’s perspective, Chiu says, sitting on $763 million in cash at the end of 1Q with no debt, but a declining production profile, an acquisition was only a matter of time. Adriatic Metals, with production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, fits in well with Dundee’s other assets in Bulgaria and Serbia, and adds more silver, lead, and zinc to the portfolio, Chiu says. Altogether, he says the acquisition is about 5% accretive to net asset value and about 15% accretive to forward cash flow.(adriano.marchese@wsj.com)\n0604 ET – With Brenntag’s changes at the top levels of management only now in progress, the charting of a new way forward is likely to be a late 2025 factor, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. This risks a cost and free cash flow overhang for the German chemicals company, the analysts say. In addition, “the compressing global chemical production cost curve and lower demand/volume levels suggest risk to short/medium-term earnings progression,” they say. Jefferies cuts its price target to 53.00 euros from 63.00 euros. Shares trade broadly flat at 60.02 euros. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0521 ET – Challenging end markets are likely to overhang Clariant’s earnings development, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. The Swiss chemical company’s net pricing should support relative resilience when compared to its peers, the analysts say. However, its midterm targets appear challenging to meet given the uncertain macro-economy, they say.

The firm says its most-likely case for gold is that prices consolidate around the $3,100 to $3,500 per troy ounce range in 3Q, before then easing more through the end of the year into 2026. Citi also believes unexpected settlements to ongoing geopolitical crises and sources of uncertainty could sink gold prices earlier than expected. Front-month gold futures settle down 1% to $3,396.40 a troy ounce, snapping a three-session winning streak for gold, but it’s still the fifth-highest close ever. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n1116 ET – London-listed gold miners trade down in late-afternoon European trade. Safe-haven demand for gold slipped as Iran signaled it would consider restarting talks over its nuclear program if the U.S. doesn’t join Israel’s attack. Gold futures are down 1.1% at $3,415.60 a troy ounce but the precious metal remains up 1.8% on week. Hochschild Mining shares trade down 5.6% while Endeavour Mining drops 3%. Gold and silver miner Fresnillo falls 1%.(adam.whittaker@wsj.com)\n1031 ET – Dundee Precious Metals’ acquisition of Adriatic Metals was a long-expected move, CIBC’s Cosmos Chiu says. From Dundee’s perspective, Chiu says, sitting on $763 million in cash at the end of 1Q with no debt, but a declining production profile, an acquisition was only a matter of time. Adriatic Metals, with production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, fits in well with Dundee’s other assets in Bulgaria and Serbia, and adds more silver, lead, and zinc to the portfolio, Chiu says. Altogether, he says the acquisition is about 5% accretive to net asset value and about 15% accretive to forward cash flow.(adriano.marchese@wsj.com)\n0604 ET – With Brenntag’s changes at the top levels of management only now in progress, the charting of a new way forward is likely to be a late 2025 factor, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. This risks a cost and free cash flow overhang for the German chemicals company, the analysts say. In addition, “the compressing global chemical production cost curve and lower demand/volume levels suggest risk to short/medium-term earnings progression,” they say. Jefferies cuts its price target to 53.00 euros from 63.00 euros. Shares trade broadly flat at 60.02 euros. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0521 ET – Challenging end markets are likely to overhang Clariant’s earnings development, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. The Swiss chemical company’s net pricing should support relative resilience when compared to its peers, the analysts say. However, its midterm targets appear challenging to meet given the uncertain macro-economy, they say. Jefferies reduces its price target to 9.50 Swiss francs from 10.90 francs, downgrading its recommendation to hold. Shares trade 1.1% lower at 8.36 francs. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)\n0235 ET – Market reactions were surprisingly muted at the start of the week despite a busy weekend of headlines, as Iran-Israel hostilities continued, says Swissquote Bank’s Ipek Ozkardeskaya. U.S. crude and Brent both opened higher but quickly gave back some gains. Natural gas also spiked at the open before retreating, while gold also pared gains as well, the senior analyst says. Some analysts argue that the conflict could ultimately dampen global growth, capping oil’s upside, she writes. Others believe that high prices could encourage shale producers to boost output. “Realistically, the risk of disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz–a critical chokepoint for a third of global oil flows–means the balance of risks remains tilted to the upside.” (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)\n2135 ET – Another leg higher for shares of miners including Anglo American and Freeport mostly depends on commodity prices rising, according to Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina. “That is fine,” he says in a note, “but it can be a short-term problem as geopolitical risks escalate…again.” LaFemina cautions to prepare for some volatility in mining stocks. In Sydney, BHP and Rio Tinto are up 0.5% and 1.2%, respectively. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2115 ET – Dundee’s roughly US$1.3 billion takeover deal with Adriatic Metals looks good for Adriatic shareholders, say Canaccord Genuity analysts Paul Howard and Alex Bedwany. The cash-and-scrip deal is only an 11% premium to Adriatic’s last closing price before the deal was announced, the analysts note. Yet it is a 51% premium to where the stock traded before Adriatic confirmed it was in talks with Dundee. It is a “strong premium if looking at the whole picture,” the analysts say. They reiterate Canaccord’s hold rating and A$5.50 target on Adriatic. The stock is up 9.4% at A$5.47. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)\n2057 ET – Nufarm is reviewing its Seed Technologies business and Bell Potter thinks a sale would be a material catalyst for the stock. It thinks a breakup could realize between A$3.73/share and A$5.16/share in value. Analyst Jonathan Snape says that assessment is based on multiples that he considers to be conservative. “An exit from Seeds would likely highlight a crop protection business trading at a 25-50% discount to peers,” Bell Potter says. It has a buy call and A$3.45/share price target on Nufarm, which is up 4.5% at A$2.34.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.\n0841 ET – Renault’s CEO Luca de Meo will leave the company next month, and his enthusiasm will be missed, Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois writes. The bank credits him for bringing back energy and peak results to Renault after years of subpar product and financials. Besides a transferable understanding of brands from his work at other automakers, he had considerable impact on staff morale when he joined, Jefferies says. “His departure leaves Renault leaderless at a time when the group is due to communicate a new strategic plan and further unwind the Nissan Alliance.” Recent management changes at Stellantis might provide a pool of applicants, Houchois adds. Shares fall 6.8%. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)\n0612 ET – Kering would likely benefit from Luca De Meo’s track record in turning around a French company if he is named CEO, RBC Capital Markets analysts Piral Dadhania and Richard Chamberlain write in a note. The luxury group is reportedly poised to appoint De Meo to the top job, after French carmaker Renault said he plans to step down as CEO in mid-July. Francois Henri-Pinault currently holds the combined position of chairman and CEO at Kering. The role is likely to be split in two, with Pinault remaining chairman and De Meo taking over as CEO. Kering has struggled to stabilize the business in recent years, the analysts say. The move signals intent to improve executive leadership capabilities and governance, they add. Shares are 9.8% higher at 189.78 euros. (andrea.figueras@wsj.com)\n0356 ET – Oil prices edge higher in early trade, adding to last week’s surge as Israel and Iran exchange strikes for a fourth day. Brent crude gains 0.2% to $74.40 a barrel, while WTI advances 0.4% to $73.23 a barrel. “The nature of the attacks by both sides over the weekend suggests risks to the oil market have escalated,” ANZ Research says. Strikes targeting Iran’s energy infrastructure–including fuel depots and a major oil refinery–have heightened concerns for global energy markets. But the greatest worry is the potential disruption of flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a vital shipping chokepoint. “The main issue the market will have to watch for is whether Iran’s retaliation broadens outside of Israel to disrupt oil flows in the Persian Gulf’s Strait of Hormuz,” according to ANZ. “Over 17 million b/d of oil supply transiting the Strait would be at risk.” (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)\n0259 ET – The departure of Renault’s CEO ahead of a reported move to lead Kering will likely be viewed positively by investors in the luxury group in the near term, Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet writes. De Meo is perceived to have contributed significantly to Renault’s turnaround through product refreshes, technological innovation, an EV transition, brand elevation, and a return to growth and profit, Chauvet says. However, the execution of luxury-brand turnarounds has become more complex, lengthy, costly and far less public-market friendly in the past few years, he adds. There is still considerable work ahead for Kering’s Gucci and Saint Laurent brands, which together account for around 80% of the group’s EBIT. A successful turnaround could lead to multiple re-ratings, the bank says. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)\n0211 ET – Renault Chief Executive Luca de Meo is stepping down and is reportedly set to join Kering, which would be a positive move for the French luxury group, Bernstein analysts write. Kering needs change, as performance has continued to deteriorate, and there has been a sense that more experience and gravitas in senior management would be appropriate, the bank adds. Luca de Meo comes with a strong track record of success in different automotive companies. As well as devising and leading Renault’s strategic plan that transformed its fortunes, Renault now has some of the most credible answers among legacy automakers to the threat posed by Chinese battery electric vehicle challengers, it adds. “Brand management and marketing are his forte, which dovetails with what the luxury industry does.” (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)\n0006 ET – Malaysia’s equity market may face limited near-term risk from Middle East tensions, but Kenanga warns prolonged conflict may raise equity risk premiums. Global leaders’ calls for restraint suggest low odds of broader conflict, though disruptions at the Strait of Hormuz remain a key risk, potentially hitting oil prices and global trade, Kenanga IB analyst Peter Kong and team say in a note. They expect Brent to retrace by 4Q as OPEC+ lifts output but see short-term upside if geopolitical tensions sustain. MISC could benefit from higher tanker rates, while Hibiscus Petroleum may gain on elevated oil prices, they say. Kenanga maintains its KLCI target at 1655 for end-2025. The KLCI is 0.3% lower at 1513.13. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2344 ET – WICE Logistics is poised for strong 2Q earnings thanks to an order windfall stemming from the 90-day pause on “reciprocal” U.S. tariffs, Thanachart Securities’ Rata Limsuthiwanpoom says in a research report. The freight forwarder had a 15% revenue exposure to the U.S. in 2024. The Thai company is also set to benefit from the improvement in its subsidiary ETL’s cross-border cold chain business, driven by effective cost management and the benefits of high operating leverage. The brokerage raises the stock’s target price to THB2.60 from THB2.30. However, it retains a sell rating, citing the stock’s expensive valuation. Shares are 2.65% lower at THB2.94. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)\n2258 ET – Westports is set for near-term earnings growth following a staggered 30% tariff hike at Port Klang, CIMB Securities analyst Mohd Shanaz Noor Azam says in a note. The tariff revision appears earnings-accretive, as container segment contribute 85.5% of Westports’s 2024 revenue, with gateway containers–45% of total throughput volume–driving most of the uplift. Transshipment gains will be more gradual due to existing agreements with shipping liners delaying tariff pass-through, he adds. The analystraises Westports’s 2025-2027 EPS forecasts by 8%-22%, noting that higher tariffs will fund expansion and offset cost pressures. CIMB lifts its target price to MYR5.10 from MYR4.50, while keeping a hold rating. Shares are 6.0% higher at MYR4.95. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n2233 ET – SIA Engineering’s growth trajectory continues to look favorable, OCBC Investment Research’s Ada Lim says in a research report. The International Air Transport Association said in early June that aircraft backlog exceeds 17,000, with implied wait time of 14 years for deliveries. The aircraft shortage means more airlines must fly older planes, the analyst says. SIA Engineering looks well-placed to capitalize on likely rapid growth of maintenance, repair and overhaul services for such planes in Asia-Pacific, given 70.4% of its FY 2025 revenue came from East Asia. OCBC raises the stock’s fair value estimate to S$3.50 from S$3.00 with an unchanged buy rating. Shares are 2.3% higher at S$3.15.
