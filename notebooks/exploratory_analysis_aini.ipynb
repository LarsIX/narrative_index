PHOTO: ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nThe Biden administration on Tuesday released a detailed plan that will make it easier for student-loan holders to wipe out their debts using income-driven repayment plans.\nThe proposed rule from the Education Department is a key step in overhauling the $1.6 trillion federal loan program that has left millions with ballooning debts. The administration first announced the change in August when it unveiled its plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt for qualifying borrowers. The Supreme Court plans next month to take up a challenge to that broader debt-forgiveness, which is frozen after being blocked by lower courts.\nYOUR MONEY BRIEFING\nNew Student-Debt Plan Would Benefit Lower-Income Borrowers\n07:44\n1x\nSUBSCRIBE\nAdd to Queue\nExplore Audio Center\nIncome-driven repayment plans were designed to help lower earners borrow for college, but few have been able to use them effectively because of technical problems and onerous amounts of income-verification paperwork. If enacted, the proposed changes would provide qualifying borrowers with significantly more-generous options that could leave them debt-free sooner, while paying off only a fraction of their total loan balances. \nTo prevent student-debt balances from ballooning in the future, the administration plans to halve, to 5% from 10%, the amount of discretionary income borrowers must pay each month on their undergraduate loans if they are enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan. Borrowers with incomes below 225% of the federal poverty line wouldn’t have to make monthly payments on their loans. The administration estimated that that level corresponds to an individual income of less than roughly $30,600 annually or any borrower in a family of four who makes less than about $62,400 a year.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat do you think of the Biden Administration’s plan to overhaul income-driven repayment programs for student loans? Join the conversation below.\nBorrower loan balances won’t grow as long as they make their monthly payments, even if a low-income borrower’s monthly requirement is set at $0. The change would also forgive loan balances for people enrolled in income-based plans after 10 years of payments, down from 20 under many of the current options, for borrowers whose original loan balances were $12,000 or less.\n“We are, for the first time, creating a student-loan safety net in this country,” said Education Department Undersecretary James Kvaal.\nThe proposed rule now must go through a 30-day public-comment period, after which the department can release a final rule.\nBorrowers and members of both parties in Congress have criticized the existing income-driven repayment program as broken. A government watchdog report last year found that only 157 borrowers out of eight million enrolled in the program successfully had their debt forgiven after decades of payments. The program has existed since 1992.\nIn its regulatory notice, the administration acknowledged that the plan would lead to “increased costs of the student loan programs to the taxpayers in the form of transfers to borrowers who would pay less on their loans.” Some opponents of debt relief, including congressional Republicans, have criticized that arrangement as unfair to taxpayers who didn’t take out loans or who paid them off in full.\nPayment-plan changes could, over time, be nearly as costly as the mass debt-cancellation plan is projected to be. A University of Pennsylvania Wharton School model suggested a range of possible price tags for the changes to income-driven repayment ranging from around $70 billion over 10 years to $450 billion over a longer period, depending on enrollment, and whether colleges continue to raise costs. \nThe shortened repayment period for borrowers with less than $12,000 in debt could make some degree-granting programs, especially at community colleges, effectively free, according to some analysts. A Biden plan to provide free community college was nixed in spending talks with congressional Democrats. \nMany borrowers already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will be closer to debt forgiveness under changes announced by the Biden administration last year. PHOTO: SAUL LOEB/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\n“Based on how much typical community-college students pay for college and earn after graduation, it would allow a great many of them to be payment-free for 10 years, or close to it,” wrote Kevin Carey, a higher-education expert at the nonpartisan New America Foundation, in a December analysis of the income-driven repayment plan based on the details the administration released last year. \nAccording to a fact sheet released Tuesday, the Department estimates that 85% of community-college borrowers would be debt free within 10 years of entering repayment.\nTo cut down on the paperwork that discourages many borrowers from signing up or remaining enrolled in payment programs, the administration aims to automate much of the process, in part by working with the Internal Revenue Service to verify borrower incomes each year.\nMany borrowers already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will be closer to debt forgiveness under changes announced by the administration last year. Borrowers who went into forbearance—a temporary payment freeze where interest continues to build up—for at least 36 months between July 2009 and March 2020 will receive at least three years of payment credit when payments resume later this year. \nThe Education Department said it would fix a longstanding problem where loan payments made to different servicers weren’t counted together, which can lead to undercounting of payments that qualify for eventual forgiveness. Those changes are likely to affect around 3.6 million borrowers, or nearly 10% of all holders of federal student loans.\nPayments and interest accrual on federal student loans have been frozen since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. They are now scheduled to resume 60 days after litigation over the loan-forgiveness program is resolved or the program is implemented.\nAdvertisement\nWrite to Gabriel T.

Attorney General Merrick Garland outlined the decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate. Photo: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\nWASHINGTON—Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday named Robert Hur, a former U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, as special counsel to examine why classified documents were found at President Biden’s home and office, intensifying scrutiny of Mr. Biden’s actions after he left the vice presidency in 2017.\nThe appointment came after Mr. Biden’s lawyer said aides found classified records, likely dating from Mr. Biden’s time as vice president, at his Wilmington, Del., garage and at an office he used at a Washington-based think tank that bears his name. It heightens political pressure on the White House and sets up the unusual prospect of three concurrent Justice Department special counsels, two of whom are investigating the actions of the president or his chief rival for office. Lawmakers from both parties in Congress have also demanded details on the discovery of the documents.\nAsk WSJ\nWhat's Next for the GOP?\nThe recent House speakership battle could reflect a larger conflict within the Republican party over its electoral and governing strategy moving forward.

But under the regulations, the extraordinary circumstances here require the appointment of a special counsel for this matter,” Mr. Garland said, adding that he would ensure Mr. Hur got the resources he needed to conduct the probe. \nMr. Hur is a longtime federal prosecutor who was the U.S. attorney in Maryland during the Trump administration and a senior aide to the deputy attorney general. He clerked for the late U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist and prosecuted dozens of financial fraud, public corruption and other cases. He most recently was a defense lawyer in private practice. \nIn a brief order, Mr. Garland said Mr. Hur would examine the possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents found at Mr. Biden’s home and the think tank. “The Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,” the order said.    \n“I will conduct the assigned investigation with fair, impartial and dispassionate judgment,” Mr. Hur said in a statement, adding that he intended to “follow the facts swiftly and thoroughly without fear or favor.”\nMr. Hur’s work will be similar to that of another special counsel, Jack Smith, a longtime public-corruption and international prosecutor, who is running an investigation into former President Donald Trump’s potential mishandling of classified records and other matters. \nRobert Hur served as the U.S. attorney in Maryland in the Trump administration. PHOTO: CHIP SOMODEVILLA/GETTY IMAGES\n“We have cooperated closely with the Justice Department throughout its review, and we will continue that cooperation with the Special Counsel,” Mr. Biden’s lawyer, Richard Sauber, said in a statement Thursday, adding that the documents were “inadvertently misplaced.”\nThe appointment was the latest of several developments this week after the White House confirmed news reports that aides had found documents with classified markings at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, the president’s Washington-based think tank, on Nov. 2, and turned them over to the National Archives. The president’s team conducted a search for any further documents, which was completed on Wednesday, Mr. Sauber said.  \nThe National Archives’s inspector general notified a Justice Department prosecutor on Nov. 4 that documents with classified markings had been discovered at the center, where they weren’t authorized to be, Mr. Garland said, offering the fullest timeline yet of the discovery. The FBI on Nov. 9 began assessing whether classified material had been mishandled in violation of federal law, and on Nov. 14, Mr. Garland tasked the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Chicago, John Lausch, with reviewing the documents.\nFive weeks later, on Dec. 20, Mr. Biden’s lawyers told Mr. Lausch that additional documents with classified markings dating to Mr. Biden’s time in the Obama administration had been discovered in the garage of Mr. Biden’s home in Wilmington, prompting the FBI to go there and retrieve them.\nThursday morning, Mr. Biden’s lawyer told Mr. Lausch that an additional document bearing classification markings was identified at the president’s home in Wilmington.\nMr. Lausch on Jan. 5 told Mr. Garland he believed further investigation by a special counsel was warranted, but that he couldn’t do that task himself because he intended to leave the department.\nResponding to repeated questioning Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said officials didn’t disclose additional documents sooner because the search and the Justice Department’s process were still ongoing. She also wouldn’t say what sparked the initial search for documents, and reiterated that Mr. Biden didn’t know what was in them.\nAdvertisement\nThe appointment of Mr. Hur adds a third special counsel to the Garland era at the Justice Department, which he has tried to insulate from partisan influence, appointing outside prosecutors even as he has attested to the department’s vaunted independence from political pressure.\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said the extraordinary circumstances required the special counsel’s appointment.

Mr. Weiss isn’t a special counsel but while other Trump U.S. attorneys left at the start of the administration, Mr. Garland kept Mr. Weiss on to similarly avoid the appearance of a conflict.\nWhile Mr. Garland and other senior Justice Department officials will be regularly briefed on the Biden documents investigation, any move to overrule a major decision by Mr. Hur would require them to notify Congress and explain their reasoning, per the special counsel regulations.\nAsked about the discovery of the latest batch of documents on Thursday, Mr. Biden said the documents had been in a locked garage with his Corvette sports car. “It’s not like they’re sitting out in the street,” he said. \nAfter reading language similar to his lawyer’s statement from the podium, the president said, “We’re going to see all this unfold,” adding, “I’m confident.”\nAsked if any countries had expressed concerns about the security of classified documents, John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said during a White House briefing Thursday: “I’m not aware of any such discussions or concerns.”\nRep.

         "Garland Names Robert Hur Special Counsel to Investigate Biden Documents Appointment comes after classified documents were found at president's think tank and. Delaware home , 10 min 006. President. Biden said. Thursday a small number of classified documents from his time as vice president were found at his home and in his personal library. Attorney. General. Merrick. Garland outlined the decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate. WASHINGTONAttorney. General. Merrick. Garland on. Thursday named. Robert. Hur, a former. U.S. attorney during the. Trump administration, as special counsel to examine why classified documents were found at. President. Biden's home and office, intensifying scrutiny of. Mr. Biden's actions after he left the vice presidency in . The appointment came after. Mr. Biden's lawyer said aides found classified records, likely dating from. Mr. Biden's time as vice president, at his. Wilmington,. Del., garage and at an office he used at a. Washington-based think tank that bears his name. It heightens political pressure on the. White. House and sets up the unusual prospect of three concurrent. Justice. Department special counsels, two of whom are investigating the actions of the president or his chief rival for office. Lawmakers from both parties in. Congress have also demanded details on the discovery of the documents. What's. Next for the. GOP? The recent. House speakership battle could reflect a larger conflict within the. Republican party over its electoral and governing strategy moving forward. WSJ reporters discuss the future of the. Republican. Party and answer your questions. \"I strongly believe that the normal processes of this department can handle all investigations with integrity. But under the regulations, the extraordinary circumstances here require the appointment of a special counsel for this matter,\". Mr. Garland said, adding that he would ensure. Mr. Hur got the resources he needed to conduct the probe. Mr. Hur is a longtime federal prosecutor who was the. U.S. attorney in. Maryland during the. Trump administration and a senior aide to the deputy attorney general. He clerked for the late. U.S. Supreme. Court. Chief. Justice. William. Rehnquist and prosecuted dozens of financial fraud, public corruption and other cases. He most recently was a defense lawyer in private practice. In a brief order,. Mr. Garland said. Mr. Hur would examine the possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents found at. Mr. Biden's home and the think tank. \"The. Special. Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,\" the order said. \"I will conduct the assigned investigation with fair, impartial and dispassionate judgment,\". Mr. Hur said in a statement, adding that he intended to \" the facts swiftly and thoroughly without fear or favor.\". Mr. Hur's work will be similar to that of another special counsel,. Jack. Smith, a longtime public-corruption and international prosecutor, who is running an investigation into former. President. Donald. Trump's potential mishandling of classified records and other matters. Robert. Hur served as the. U.S. attorney in. Maryland in the. Trump administration. \"We have cooperated closely with the. Justice. Department throughout its review, and we will continue that cooperation with the. Special. Counsel,\". Mr. Biden's lawyer,. Richard. Sauber, said in a statement. Thursday, adding that the documents were \"inadvertently misplaced.\". The appointment was the latest of several developments this week after the. White. House confirmed news reports that aides had found documents with classified markings at the. Penn. Biden. Center for. Diplomacy and. Global. Engagement, the president's. Washington-based think tank, on. Nov. 2, and turned them over to the. National. Archives. The president's team conducted a search for any further documents, which was completed on. Wednesday,. Mr. Sauber said. The. National. Archives's inspector general notified a. Justice. Department prosecutor on. Nov. 4 that documents with classified markings had been discovered at the center, where they weren't authorized to be,. Mr. Garland said, offering the fullest timeline yet of the discovery. The. FBI on. Nov. 9 began assessing whether classified material had been mishandled in violation of federal law, and on. Nov. 14,. Mr. Garland tasked the. Trump-appointed. U.S. attorney in. Chicago,. John. Lausch, with reviewing the documents. Five weeks later, on. Dec. 20,. Mr. Biden's lawyers told. Mr. Lausch that additional documents with classified markings dating to. Mr. Biden's time in the. Obama administration had been discovered in the garage of. Mr. Biden's home in. Wilmington, prompting the. FBI to go there and retrieve them. Thursday morning,. Mr. Biden's lawyer told. Mr. Lausch that an additional document bearing classification markings was identified at the president's home in. Wilmington. Mr. Lausch on. Jan. 5 told. Mr. Garland he believed further investigation by a special counsel was warranted, but that he couldn't do that task himself because he intended to leave the department. Responding to repeated questioning. Thursday,. White. House press secretary. Karine. Jean-Pierre said officials didn't disclose additional documents sooner because the search and the. Justice. Department's process were still ongoing. She also wouldn't say what sparked the initial search for documents, and reiterated that. Mr. Biden didn't know what was in them. The appointment of. Mr. Hur adds a third special counsel to the. Garland era at the. Justice. Department, which he has tried to insulate from partisan influence, appointing outside prosecutors even as he has attested to the department's vaunted independence from political pressure. Attorney. General. Merrick. Garland said the extraordinary circumstances required the special counsel's appointment. John. Durham, a former. U.S. attorney in. Connecticut, is continuing as special counsel to investigate the. FBI's handling of a inquiry into. Russia's interference in that year's presidential election and any links to the. Trump campaign. At the same time,. David. Weiss, the. Trump-appointed. U.S. attorney in. Delaware, is examining whether to bring a criminal case against. Mr. Biden's son,. Hunter. Biden, related to his tax dealings and a gun isn't a special counsel but while other. Trump. U.S. attorneys left at the start of the administration,. Mr. Garland kept. Mr. Weiss on to similarly avoid the appearance of a conflict. While. Mr. Garland and other senior. Justice. Department officials will be regularly briefed on the. Biden documents investigation, any move to overrule a major decision by. Mr. Hur would require them to notify. Congress and explain their reasoning, per the special counsel regulations. Asked about the discovery of the latest batch of documents on. Thursday,. Mr. Biden said the documents had been in a locked garage with his. Corvette sports car. \"It's not like they're sitting out in the street,\" he said. After reading language similar to his lawyer's statement from the podium, the president said, \"We're going to see all this unfold,\" adding, \"I'm confident.\". Asked if any countries had expressed concerns about the security of classified documents,. John. Kirby, a spokesman for the. National. Security. Council, said during a. White. House briefing. Thursday \"I'm not aware of any such discussions or concerns.\". Rep. Mike. Turner. R. Ohio, the top. Republican on the. House. Intelligence. Committee, asked the attorney general and. Director of. National. Intelligence. Avril. Haines to participate in a classified briefing on the matter. \"The presence of classified information at these separate locations could implicate. President. Joe. Biden in the mishandling, potential misuse, and exposure of classified information,\". Mr. Turner said in a statement on. Thursday. Before. Mr. Garland made his announcement,. House. Speaker. Kevin. McCarthy. R.,. Calif. alleged. Thursday morning that there was a double standard in how the federal government treated the. Democratic president and. Mr. Trump. \"Treating law differently based on your political beliefsthat's why we had to provide a new entity\" to \"look after the weaponization of what's going on,\". Mr. McCarthy said, referring to. House. Republicans' creation of a new subcommittee to probe the. Justice. Department's handling of sensitive investigations such as the one into. Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has joined fellow. Republicans in accusing. Mr. Biden of hypocrisy on the issue. FBI agents found hundreds of classified and other government documents at. Mr. Trump's. Mar-a-Lago resort in. August in boxes mixed in with clothing and news 's lawyers had previously said they had turned such documents over to authorities. \"It would not be surprising to learn that every single vice president and president since. Eisenhower has left the. West. Wing with classified documents and didn't even know it,\" said. Jay. Town, a former. U.S. attorney in the. Trump administration. \"We just have to have an understanding as to whether it was intentional or not, but it's clear that this just happens to our executives. That reality needs to be built into any charging decision.\". NEWSLETTER. SIGN-UP. Get email notifications about major political news, from campaigns to the. Capitol. It isn't publicly known how much information is classified , but watchdogs and open-government activists believe such a trove is likely to include billions of recordsa sum that expands each year in part due to the ever-widening use of digital communications. Recently some. Biden administration officials, including. Ms. Haines, the director of national intelligence, have said overclassification is a national-security issue that hampers intelligence sharing among agencies and with partners, and contributes to public distrust in government. The. White. House is currently working on an executive order, expected later this year, that is intended to overhaul aspects of the classification system, and the administration has released previously classified files about high-profile matters, including the. John. F. Kennedy assassination,. Jamal. Khashoggi's murder and unidentified aerial phenomena, the last of which saw a new report published on. Thursday.

ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP/GETTY IMAGES\nBy\nKen Thomas\nFollow\nand\nSabrina Siddiqui\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 13, 2023 5:52 pm ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(8 min)\nWASHINGTON—President Biden’s departure from the White House in January 2017 involved a rush to pack up documents and other belongings, former aides said, as the then-vice president embarked on an intense stretch of domestic and international travel and a series of official events.\nDuring those final weeks, staff members were tasked with packing up Mr. Biden’s West Wing office, where he did much of his work, along with his larger office space at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building near the White House and his residence at the Naval Observatory.\nThat push to close down Mr. Biden’s eight years as vice president has come under intense scrutiny with the recent revelations that classified documents from that period were recently found at a Washington office used by Mr. Biden, and later inside a garage in his home in Wilmington, Del., according to a lawyer for the president. \nMuch remains unknown about how the documents came to be in those places or who put them there, and the White House has declined to provide detailed answers. But the revelations have raised concerns about Mr. Biden’s handling of the nation’s secrets and put the White House on the defensive over the manner in which they disclosed to the public the scope of the mishandled classified documents. \nThe White House said aides had found “a small number” of documents with classified markings at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, Mr. Biden’s post-vice presidential think tank, on Nov. 2, six days before the midterm elections, and turned them over to the National Archives. \nThe White House also said that on Dec. 20, Mr. Biden’s lawyers informed the Justice Department that additional documents with classified markings dating back to Mr. Biden’s time as vice president had been discovered in the garage of Mr. Biden’s home in Wilmington, near his 1967 Corvette Stingray. That prompted the FBI to retrieve the material. On Thursday morning, Mr. Biden’s lawyer informed the government that an additional document bearing classified markings was identified at the president’s home in Wilmington.\nOn Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland named Robert Hur, a former U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, as special counsel to examine the classified documents case.\nBiden ‘Cooperating Fully’ With DOJ as Garland Appoints Special Counsel\nPlay video: Biden ‘Cooperating Fully’ With DOJ as Garland Appoints Special Counsel\nPresident Biden said Thursday a “small number” of classified documents from his time as vice president were found at his home and in his personal library. Attorney General Merrick Garland outlined the decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate. Photo: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\nThe White House has said Mr. Biden didn’t know the documents had been stored in the two locations nor did he know what was in the documents. The president, during a news conference Tuesday that capped off a visit to Mexico, said he was surprised by the discovery and was cooperating on the matter. \nMr. Biden’s lawyer, Richard Sauber, has said the White House is confident that the Justice Department review “will show that these documents were inadvertently misplaced, and the president and his lawyers acted promptly upon discovery of this mistake.”\nRepublicans have accused the Justice Department of maintaining a double standard on the issue of retention of classified documents because it obtained a warrant to search the Florida home of former President Donald Trump over his holding of top secret documents as part of a criminal investigation. \nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWSJ Politics & Policy\nScoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nThe Justice Department has indicated that part of its investigation includes potential obstruction, after the issue was referred to prosecutors by the National Archives following months of negotiations with Mr. Trump’s lawyers. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and described the investigation as a witch hunt. \nSome of President Biden’s current advisers worked with him during his final days as vice president, including counselor Steve Ricchetti, who was Mr. Biden’s last vice presidential chief of staff, communications director Kate Bedingfield, who held the same position from 2015 to 2017, and chief speechwriter Vinay Reddy. The White House has referred questions about the documents to the Justice Department, which declined to comment.\nFormer aides said the vice president’s general counsel’s office oversaw the documents retention process. Mr. Biden’s executive assistant at the time, Kathy Chung, was most heavily involved in the packing up of the office, according to former aides, but was helped by other lower-level staff members.\nMs. Chung, who now serves as deputy director of protocol for Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, was interviewed by federal investigators late last year about the discovered documents, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Pentagon on Friday declined to make Ms. Chung available for comment and referred calls to the Justice Department, which declined to comment. \nThe Washington, D.C., office building that houses the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, Mr. Biden’s post-vice presidential think tank, where aides discovered ‘a small number’ of classified documents last year. PHOTO: JIM LO SCALZO/SHUTTERSTOCK\nFormer aides described a frenetic few weeks before Mr. Trump took office as Mr. Biden crisscrossed the nation and embarked on a final foreign trip to Ukraine and Switzerland shortly before the inauguration. That busy travel schedule created new documents and papers up until the final day and complicated the packing process, they said. With many senior staff members on the road with Mr. Biden, some aides described a depleted staff in Washington trying to clear the vice president’s offices as the transition of power loomed. \nSome members of Mr. Biden staff had already departed their roles, they said, and those who remained worked to maintain daily briefings and operations in a hectic final sprint while sorting through documents and belongings that were no longer needed.\nDuring his final two weeks, Mr. Biden presided over Congress for the counting of the electoral votes for the 2016 election, and then took a trip to California, where he appeared at a fundraiser for then Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and delivered a speech at a healthcare conference in San Francisco. After departing California, Mr. Biden attended an event in Chicago with outgoing President Barack Obama and then stopped in Detroit to visit the North American International Auto Show.\nAdvertisement\nDays later, Mr. Biden was surprised by Mr. Obama with the presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House, an event that brought together the then-vice president’s large extended family. \nMr. Biden then traveled to New York for an appearance on ABC’s “The View,” where he noted that he had personally written a classified memorandum for Vice President-elect Mike Pence. “He’ll call me and ask about, or I’ll call him about what’s going on in Ukraine, what’s going on here, what’s going on there,” Mr. Biden said at the time.\nThe capstone of his final days was a trip to Kyiv for a meeting with then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Among the classified documents discovered in the locales associated with Mr. Biden was a briefing paper related to Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nVice President Biden in Kyiv, Ukraine, with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, on one of Mr. Biden’s final days in office in January 2017. PHOTO: SERGII KHARCHENKO/NURPHOTO/GETTY IMAGES\nFrom there, Mr. Biden flew to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum, where he addressed the forum, quipping to the audience, “I’ll be vice president of the United States for 48 more hours.” The stop in Davos included a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

It also said the U.K. will start training Ukrainian armed forces on the tanks and guns in coming days.\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWhat’s News\nCatch up on the headlines, understand the news and make better decisions, free in your inbox daily.

A top German official said Germany would follow up on its pledge to send main battle tanks if other Western allies do so.\nMr. Zelensky tweeted that the U.K.’s decision “will not only strengthen us on the battlefield, but also send the right signal to other partners.” The commander in chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in December that the army needs 300 tanks to win back territory the Russians conquered last year, an analysis that Western military officials agree with. \nIn its statement, the British government said it would accelerate diplomatic and military support to aid Ukraine’s efforts to push back Russian forces as the anniversary of the war approaches late next month. “The Prime Minister is clear that a long and static war only serves Russia’s ends,” the statement said.\nThe initial provision of a small number of advanced tanks won’t by itself make a big or immediate difference on the battlefield, said Franz-Stefan Gady, a fellow with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. The logistics of setting up supply chains, fuel lines and trained crews for the complex machinery means the West isn’t likely to be able to deliver tanks in the kinds of numbers that would make a significant impact for at least many months to come.\nChallenger 2 tanks in a NATO exercise last spring in Estonia. PHOTO: BEN BIRCHALL/PA WIRE/ZUMA PRESS\nThat said, even providing a few dozen tanks means creating the repair yards and logistical centers that could make it much easier to send the next round of heavy combat vehicles. It signals a lasting commitment to building up Ukraine’s military, countering Russian President Vladimir Putin’s bet that the West will soon tire of aiding Ukraine, said Mr. Gady.\n“It will send a clear message that the West is in for the long haul,” he said. “Even for these small [numbers of] tanks you would need to build up a logistical supply chain. You could slowly build on that.”\nThere are some 2,000 Leopard 2 tanks held by 13 militaries across Europe including Turkey, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank. It notes that global stocks of these tanks are in varying states of readiness. Canada, for example, has an inventory of more than 80, but half are set aside for training purposes. For the moment, the only other country that has made a specific pledge is Poland, which has offered a company—typically 14 tanks.\nThe Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which coordinates support for Ukraine and includes defense ministers and military officials from around the world, is due to meet Jan 20. Members are expected to discuss how best to support Kyiv. German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said Thursday that Germany shouldn’t stand in the way of countries that want to send Leopards to Ukraine.\nRussia’s Embassy in the U.K. said Saturday that the tanks are “unlikely to help the Armed Forces of Ukraine turn the tide on the battlefield, and they will become a legitimate large target for Russian guns,” in comments carried by Russian state news agency TASS.\nBritish officials believe that, as the war in Ukraine shifts to a new phase, it makes sense to provide the Ukrainian army with heavy armor, something that was almost inconceivable just a few months ago. Russia is mobilizing personnel to the front lines, such as at the eastern city of Bakhmut, creating a numerical advantage that could work against Ukraine. If Ukraine is to mount a spring counterattack, it needs tanks to clear Russian lines without incurring huge losses in personnel, according to military analysts.\nAdvertisement\nFrance has pledged to send AMX-10 armored vehicles to Ukraine. PHOTO: EMMANUEL DUNAND/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nMoreover, some British officials feel that the West needs to more aggressively tilt the advantage in Ukraine’s favor with a larger supply of weapons to quickly help Ukraine into a position of relative strength from which it can negotiate an end to the war with Russia. Without this infusion of weaponry, they fear the war could drag on for years.  \nThe British Army’s Challenger 2 is more than two decades old, but it will still be the most advanced tank the Ukrainians have fielded in battle. Up until now, most of the heavy armor provided by NATO allies such as Poland have been old Soviet-era tanks. The U.K. has a stock of around 227 Challenger 2 tanks and is in the process of replacing them with a modernized version.  \nBiden administration officials have said they don’t object to other countries providing tanks and welcome the British contribution. Meanwhile, they remain open to providing U.S. Abrams tanks to Ukraine but haven’t decided to do so, nor do they anticipate that tanks would be announced in the near future, officials said this past week. \n“This is something that we absolutely agree that Ukraine does need tanks,” said Laura Cooper, a top Pentagon policy official, earlier this month. But the U.S. remains worried about the training and logistics required to use an Abrams tank, which Ms. Cooper said is a “gas guzzler.”\nThe U.S. wants to make sure Ukrainians can operate and maintain the tanks before the U.S. provides them, administration officials said. In addition to the British tanks, the U.S. and the Netherlands paid to refurbish T-72 tanks, which are arriving on the battlefield in Ukraine this month. \nUntil recent weeks, the issue of tanks was largely taboo. Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other allies such as Australia supplied armored military vehicles that separately have many characteristics of tanks, such as heavy armor, big guns and caterpillar treads, but not all in one system.\nFrance recently said it would send AMX-10s, which have a cannon but are considered light tanks because they have wheels rather than treads. The U.S. said earlier this month that it plans to send Bradley Fighting Vehicles, which have treads and heavy armor but don’t carry a large cannon, as a main battle tank does.\nBojan Pancevski contributed to this article.\nWrite to Max Colchester at Max.Colchester@wsj.com and Drew Hinshaw at drew.hinshaw@wsj.com\nThe War in Ukraine\nNews and insights, selected by the editors\nThe Tensions Surrounding Ukraine’s Crimea\nTrump Rebukes Putin After Russian Attack on Kyiv\nTrump Blames Zelensky as Ukraine Peace Talks Stumble\nZelensky Pushes Back on U.S. Peace Plan\nUkraine and Russia Had Cease-Fires Before.

PHOTO: DAVOUD HOSSEINI/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nIran said Saturday it had executed a former high-ranking defense official and dual British citizen on charges of espionage, a move likely to exacerbate tensions with the West as the government is wrestling with nationwide protests.\nAlireza Akbari, a former deputy defense minister, was convicted of passing classified national-security information to the British foreign intelligence service, MI6, in return for more than $2 million in foreign currencies, the Iranian judiciary’s news agency, Mizan, said.\nMr. Akbari had been hanged, according to Mizan, which didn’t specify when the execution had taken place and didn’t provide more details.\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWhat’s News\nCatch up on the headlines, understand the news and make better decisions, free in your inbox daily. Enjoy a free article in every edition.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nThe Iranian Intelligence Ministry called Mr. Akbari a super spy and one of the most important informants of the British intelligence service. The judiciary said he had been recruited as a spy by British diplomats under the cover of establishing trade relations.\nMr. Akbari is believed to have been arrested in Tehran two or three years ago, but his arrest was made public in the past week. He is the first known dual European citizen and prominent Iranian official and veteran of the elite Revolutionary Guard to be executed in Iran in decades.\n“This was a callous and cowardly act, carried out by a barbaric regime with no respect for the human rights of their own people,” British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Saturday on Twitter.\nBritish Foreign Secretary James Cleverly called the execution “a barbaric act” and said it was politically motivated.\nThe execution is likely to worsen relations with the West, which have been severely strained since talks to revive an international deal that would lift sanctions on Tehran and curb its nuclear program were suspended last year.\nIran has come under heavy international criticism for its crackdown of a protest movement that erupted in September following the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman arrested for allegedly violating the country’s strict Islamic dress code.

PHOTO: CHET STRANGE FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nWorker pay increases fell behind inflation in 2022 for the second year in a row, leaving households worse off despite historically strong pay gains. \nBut recent data suggest a shift is under way, with paycheck totals gaining ground as inflation eases. Whether the trend continues in 2023 depends on the path of the economy, which is cooling as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and faces the risk of a recession.\nA historically tight labor market pushed up average hourly earnings by 4.6% in December from a year earlier, the Labor Department said this week, compared with a 6.5% annual inflation rate in the same period. Likewise, average hourly earnings rose 4.9% in December 2021 from a year earlier, compared with a 7% annual inflation rate. \nReal average hourly earnings, change from a year earlier\nSource: Labor Department\nNote: Seasonally adjusted\nCreated with Highcharts 9.0.1\n2017\n'20\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n%\nThe result: Worker pay actually fell the past two years after accounting for inflation. Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings—or real earnings—were down 1.7% in December 2022 from a year earlier, following a 2.1% decline in December 2021. \nIn the long run, wage increases tend to move alongside inflation, economists say. But at times of economic upheaval, such as during the pandemic, the gap between the two can widen.\nDuring the past two years, supply-chain disruptions related to the pandemic and higher energy costs linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused inflation to outpace wage gains. The effect of these supply factors is now fading, putting less pressure on consumer prices.\nBoth pay increases and inflation have been cooling since the middle of last year. But for the past two months inflation has been easing more than wages, giving paychecks a boost.\nAs a result, this could be the year that workers start seeing real wage gains again. \n“The question for 2023 is which moderates faster: inflation or wages,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, a payroll processor.\nOrdinarily, if paychecks aren’t keeping up with inflation, households would be forced to cut back on spending, which could send the economy into a downturn.\nIn this case, households benefited from huge amounts of pent-up savings, thanks to multiple rounds of federal stimulus and reduced spending during the early months of the pandemic. Families tapped into those savings last year to keep up their consumption.\nInflation-adjusted consumer spending either rose or held level every month of last year through November, according to the latest data available, indicating that consumers have yet to pull back.\nAmy Hekman, of Grand Rapids, Mich., lost her job at an early-childhood nonprofit early in the pandemic. But higher unemployment insurance payments included in 2020 pandemic stimulus kept her afloat, she said. \nAmy Hekman, of Grand Rapids, Mich., says a big jump in rent has prompted her to think about a new, more lucrative career. PHOTO: AMY HEKMAN\nHer rent has gone up 30% over three years, “not including groceries, gas and all those other things that have increased as well,” she said, prompting her to think about a new, more lucrative career.\nIn 2021, she started taking on temporary work assignments in human resources, looking to make a career change. Now she is interviewing for full-time human-resources jobs that could allow her to better absorb higher prices.\n“I am only looking for positions that would put me ahead,” she said.\nIn recent months, the savings cushion that Americans have built up has been slowly shrinking. Fed researchers estimated the total amount of excess savings fell to $1.7 trillion midway through 2022, from $2.3 trillion in the third quarter of 2021.\n“As of now, the consumer is still holding up,” said Ms. Richardson. “This is really a race against the clock to restore inflation to more tolerable levels and then let the job market do what it does, which in a tight labor market is keep wages robust. That’s hopefully what happens this year.”\nFed officials have been worried that rising wages and high inflation could feed off each other, causing a spiral. So far, that hasn’t happened. Officials have said they want to see wage increases ease, which could take some pressure off inflation.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s not that we don’t want wage increases,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this past month. “We want strong wage increases. We just want them to be at a level that’s consistent with 2% inflation.”\nRight now, he added, wage gains are “well above” that level.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nDo you feel like your wages are keeping pace with inflation? Join the conversation below.\nWages tend to be “stickier” than inflation, said Credit Suisse economist Jeremy Schwartz. They don’t rise and fall as rapidly as consumer prices. That means wage gains could exceed inflation for a little while until they come back into rough alignment, he said.\nMr. Schwartz sees year-over-year wage increases falling to just above 4% by the end of 2023, while inflation weakens to around 3% on the year.\n“In terms of not seeing such painful price increases and having your income stretch further, this could be a pretty good year for consumers,” he said.\nDespite the possible return of real wage gains, workers could suffer if the economy tips into recession this year, as many economists expect. A recession would likely lead to layoffs and push up the unemployment rate from December’s 3.5%. Fed officials see the unemployment rate rising to 4.6% by the end of the year.\n“If you retain a job you’ll be in better shape,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. “It’s just that there’s going to be an increased risk of layoffs for this year.”\nWrite to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com\nInflation and the Economy\nAnalysis from The Wall Street Journal, selected by the editors\nInflation Has Cooled, but Americans Are Still Seething Over Prices\nLower Interest Rates Don’t Guarantee a Soft Landing\nThe American Dream Feels Out of Reach for Most\nInflation's Impact on the Poor vs. the Rich\nSHOW CONVERSATION (185)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nFurther Reading\nPowell Steers New Strategy for a World Where Very Low Rates Are No Sure Thing\nTreasury Yields Rise Amid Trade Talk Developments\nWeek Ahead for FX, Bonds: Focus on Trade News, U.S. Inflation, Retail Sales Data\nOPINION\nA New Strategy to Fight Inflation\nWhy the Fed Isn’t Ready to Join Other Central Banks in Cutting Rates",

PHOTO: MARK KAUZLARICH FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nVeterans facing a suicide crisis, even those not enrolled in the VA system, can get immediate and free treatment, the Department of Veterans Affairs said Friday, part of a decadelong effort to combat mental-health issues that have long racked the veteran community.\nThe VA has taken a more robust approach to addressing veteran suicide in recent years—especially suicide by firearm, which disproportionately affects the veteran community. VA officials are trying to find ways to address concerns many veterans have about seeking mental-health treatment or discussing their guns and firearms safety. \nMost veterans are now eligible for 30 days of inpatient or 90 days of outpatient care, and the VA said it is streamlining access to private facilities for those deemed to be at imminent risk of self-harm. The change expands eligibility for such services to also include the approximately nine million veterans who aren’t enrolled in the VA system.\nThe VA effort has also included a partnership with the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a major firearms trade group, to bridge political and ideological divisions. Next week, for the first time, the VA will headline part of the NSSF’s shooting, hunting and outdoor trade event known as SHOT Show, the nation’s largest firearms trade show. \nThe check-in desk at a VA outpatient clinic in Portland, Maine. PHOTO: PATRICK OUELLETTE/PORTLAND PRESS HERALD/GETTY IMAGES\nThe renewed push to address veteran suicide-by-firearm began during the Trump administration in 2017 and 2018, said Dr. Matthew Miller, head of suicide prevention for the VA. \n“We sat down at VA and said we need to do something more,” he said in an interview. “We said, ‘Why don’t we do something about the factor that’s involved with 70% of suicides?’ And that’s firearms.”\nVeterans are more likely than civilians to own firearms, and they are more likely to use them for suicide, according to VA statistics. And gun owners can become defensive about any effort to address firearm restrictions, which precluded discussion of preventing firearm suicide in the past, said Ari Freilich, state policy director at Giffords Law Center, which seeks to end gun violence.\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nThe 10-Point\nA personal, guided tour to the best scoops and stories every day in The Wall Street Journal.\nPreview\nSubscribed\n“It’s really important to talk about where we were a decade ago,” he said, with gun companies and lobbyists all but refusing to talk about links between firearm access and suicide. \nSince then, groups such as the NSSF have begun to address the need to talk about firearm suicide. Mr. Freilich said the industry should have talked about these matters long ago, and that it continues to profit off weapons that bring people harm, but it is important to recognize the crucial change that has taken place.\n“We need credible messengers to reach people where they are and trust it,” he said. “That’s such a bedrock of our work.”\nWhile there are political policy debates about ways to address firearms issues through legislation, these disparate groups have tried to find common ground and focus on solutions that can save lives. One such solution is widespread use of gun locks and having gun owners put what is known as time and distance between themselves and firearms and ammunition when possible. That includes storing ammunition separately from weapons and even persuading gun owners to trust someone close to them to safeguard their guns for them when they might be in crisis.\nIn 2016, NSSF joined with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention after gun retailers and members began asking more about the issue, said Dr. Doreen Marshall, vice president of mission engagement for the suicide-prevention organization.\n“NSSF saying, ‘This is important’—it changed the dialogue nationally,” she said.\nThen in 2019, the NSSF joined with the VA to bring the message to veterans.\nRep. Chris Stewart says his work with veterans made him realize the acute crisis that needed to be addressed.  PHOTO: GEORGE FREY/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n“Organizations like the VA recognize that we have the ability to reach a community that they might not be able to reach,” said Joe Bartozzi, president and chief executive of the NSSF. “I’d like to believe that it has helped to open up the dialogue.”\nMr. Bartozzi said veterans need to understand that they can get assistance for mental-health crises and not be in danger of having their weapons confiscated, a common concern among the demographic. He said his organization’s members have asked for more training and information on suicide prevention, and because it is coming from their trusted organization, it has opened up the conversation in ways that weren’t possible in the past.\nThe VA has tailored messaging so that it focuses not on restricting access to firearms but on safety surrounding the use, storage and understanding of firearms, Dr. Miller of the VA said.\nAdvertisement\nThat includes advocating for training doctors and mental-health professionals in the basics of gun culture and concerns gun owners have about seeking mental-health treatment. Dr. Miller said such training modules have become standard at the VA. \n“Suicide is preventable, and once you understand that concept, there’s no reason not to get involved,” Mr. Bartozzi said.\nEven as the VA has expanded efforts, officials say more can be done, especially in tracking outcomes. Dr. Miller said the VA doesn’t have reliable statistics on the outcomes of many of the programs because it is nearly impossible to point to one variable in something as complicated as suicide. But he said this year funding has been set aside to better assess outcomes. \nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nIs encouraging gun safety an effective way to prevent suicides? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\nAccording to the VA’s most recent statistics, veteran suicide rates were up in 2018 and then fell for two straight years (the department’s statistics lag behind by two years). But suicide among veterans remains higher than among the civilian population. \nMany lawmakers in Washington have sought to address suicide prevention, and some of the biggest proponents of such measures say they have to keep some distance from efforts like those being made by the VA and the NSSF.\n“We have, by intention, stayed out of those conversations,” said Rep.

Join the conversation below. The. Supreme. Court's ruling meant that. Native. Americans who commit crimes on tribal land can't be prosecuted . Criminal charges have to be prosecuted in tribal or federal courts. Subsequent litigation following the high court's ruling led to a decision that held that \"the federal government and the state have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against. Indians in. Indian country.\". Mr. Stitt has butted heads with the state's tribes since taking office in , when he proposed an increase in the revenue rate tribes pay to run their casinos. The tribes successfully sued and the rates remained the same. In ,. Mr. Stitt's office refused to renew. Oklahoma's hunting and fishing licenses with the. Cherokee and. Choctaw nations, which brought in 38 million in revenue. The governor also entered into new gaming contracts in with four tribes that weren't part of. Oklahoma's original tribal gaming compact, triggering a flurry of litigation that still isn't settled. Oklahoma. Gov. Kevin. Stitt, a. Republican and. Cherokee. Nation member, has butted heads with the state's tribes since taking office in . The state's action in. Mr. Ward's obscure hunting violation case was based on the argument that it has civil jurisdiction in such cases. The. McGirt ruling didn't address the civil jurisdiction over non-Natives on tribal land and. Native. Americans who were on reservation lands belonging to tribes other than their own. Court documents written by. Mr. Stitt's general counsel,. Trevor. Pemberton, and signed by a county prosecutor said the. Supreme. Court's decision didn't change civil jurisdiction in the state. Under federal law, the state and prosecutors said,. Oklahoma has jurisdiction on civil matters that involve. Native. Americans even if they're on tribal land. Oklahoma has the right to enforce wildlife conservation laws regardless of tribal membership status, race, heritage or background, according to court filings. The impact of. McGirt on civil matters is of particular interest to. Oklahoma,. Mr. Miller said, as the decision has been cited in other cases that challenge the state's power to levy taxes and regulate surface mining and reclamation operations on tribal lands. 'I missed days and a lot of time from work going to these powers-from-above meetings,'. Jimmy. Ward said. Nathan. Clark,. Mr. Ward's attorney in the civil forfeiture case, said the case was a very purposeful intrusion the jurisdiction of tribal lands. \"There's a tension about how far. McGirt goes that's fueling the state of. Oklahoma's response,\". Mr. Clark said. In. October,. Carter. County. Judge. Carson. Brooks denied. Mr. Ward's motion to dismiss the civil forfeiture case alleging the court and the state lacked jurisdiction. On. Friday,. Mr. Ward agreed to forfeit his gun and not fight the civil case,. Mr. Clark said, adding that the state and the tribes need to work together. Oklahoma's new attorney general,. Gentner. Drummond, didn't respond to a request for comment, but in a statement released. Monday shortly after being sworn in,. Mr. Drummond said improving tribal relations was a priority. \"Oklahoma's relationship with our great tribal nations has been damaged and combative litigation,\". Mr. Drummond said. \"Oklahoma must forge common-sense agreements with our tribal brothers and sisters that respect their sovereignty and ensure public safety.\". Secret. Purges,. Tense. Standoffs.

Al Sharpton and President Biden at the National Action Network’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast in Washington on Monday. PHOTO: ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nWASHINGTON—President Biden declared the nation at “a time for choosing” in a Monday speech marking the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday and paying tribute to the civil rights icon’s legacy.    \n“This is a time for choosing,” Mr. Biden said at an annual breakfast in Washington hosted by the National Action Network and the Rev. Al Sharpton on what would have been Dr. King’s 94th birthday. “Will we choose democracy over autocracy, community over chaos, love over hate? These are the questions of our time.”\nThe remarks came a day after Mr. Biden traveled to Atlanta for another celebration commemorating Dr. King, whom he referred to as one of his “only political heroes,” at Ebenezer Baptist Church. Speaking before an audience that included Dr. King’s sister, Christine King Farris, and other members of his family, Mr. Biden became the first sitting president to deliver a Sunday sermon at the historic church where Dr. King often preached. \nIn both speeches, Mr. Biden struck a somber tone as he spoke of an “inflection point” for civil rights, democracy and social justice. Whereas the president spent much of his Sunday sermon drawing on the teachings of Dr. King, whom he praised as a “nonviolent warrior for justice,” Mr. Biden’s remarks at Monday’s breakfast were more centered around his political agenda and congressional Republicans.\nMartin Luther King Jr. Honored\nThe nation celebrated the life and achievements of the U.S. civil-rights leader on Monday\n1 of 2\nANDREW HARNIK/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n1\n2\nMr. Biden said he stands ready to work with the new Republican House majority, even as he criticized GOP lawmakers for blocking police reform and voting rights legislation.

Let’s look at the places that we can change our behavior,” Mr. McCarthy said in an interview on Fox News. “Why would we sit back and be so arrogant to say, ‘No, there’s no waste in government?’”\nMr. Biden also objected to Republicans who have sought to play down the legacy of slavery, segregation and racial discrimination in the U.S., stating that “silence is complicity.”  \n“The idea that we’re supposed to remain silent on the abuses of the past as if they didn’t occur?

BABA 1.82%\nincrease; green up pointing triangle\nstarted allowing shoppers in Europe to pay for purchases on its international e-commerce platform only after receiving their merchandise, in an attempt to boost global sales as growth at home slows. \nOn Monday, a fintech company called Splitit Payments Ltd. said it would join with Ant Group Co.’s Alipay to provide a delayed-payment option to customers of AliExpress, an online marketplace operated by Alibaba outside of China. \nSlowing Growth\nAlibaba's quarterly revenue\nSource: S&P Capital IQ\nNote: 100 billion yuan=$14.9 billion\nCreated with Highcharts 9.0.1\n2020\n'21\n'22\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nbillion yuan\nThe service will first be rolled out in Germany, Spain and France and could expand into other international markets, said Splitit, which is based in Atlanta, Ga., and is listed in Australia. Called “Pay After Delivery,” it enables individuals to pay for their merchandise in installments via their credit cards.\nAliExpress was founded in 2010 and sells toys, clothes, electronic gadgets and other consumer products to more than 200 countries, according to its website. Most sellers on the platform are China-based businesses and their international shipping times are often long, which is a deterrent to shoppers.  \nAn AliExpress spokesman said that for major European cities such as Paris and Madrid, goods can be delivered in 10 working days. For more remote areas in Europe, delivery times are 15 to 20 days on average, he added. The company also provides a delivery guarantee, which provides some compensation to shoppers if their merchandise isn’t delivered on time. \nOrders placed through AliExpress fell in Alibaba’s last three fiscal quarterly reports. The company said demand was hurt by the weakened euro against U.S. dollar, changes in the European Union’s tax rules and supply chain and logistics disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.\nThe payments tie-up comes at a time when Chinese e-commerce companies are looking more abroad to bolster sluggish sales growth at home. Once one of China’s fastest-growing tech businesses, Alibaba’s revenue for its last two fiscal quarters was little changed from the year-earlier periods as a result of a slowdown in consumer spending during China’s strict zero-Covid policy. The company also swung to a net loss in the July-to-September quarter. \nLast year, Alibaba Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said globalization was one of the company’s three key strategies, along with consumption and cloud computing. Alibaba’s international retail business, which includes AliExpress, contributes only 5% to the company’s total revenue. AliExpress is facing growing competition from other Chinese-owned online retailers, including fast-fashion giant Shein and Pinduoduo Inc.’s four-month-old American subsidiary Temu. \nAn AliExpress logo at a self-service delivery station in Poland last year. PHOTO: BEATA ZAWRZEL/ZUMA PRESS\nBuy now, pay later services have been gaining traction worldwide, despite retailers or merchants having to swallow the financing cost for what are often interest-free loans. Within mainland China, Ant—which is one-third owned by Alibaba—has long provided short-term financing options to shoppers on Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms. \nUnder the Splitit-Alipay tie-up, a hold will be put on shoppers’ credit cards when they make purchases on AliExpress. After customers confirm receipt of their goods, the money will be transferred to the sellers. Shares of Splitit closed 22% higher on Monday, while Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listed shares were little changed. \nAdvertisement\nWrite to Clarence Leong at clarence.leong@wsj.com and Shen Lu at shen.lu@wsj.com\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nFurther Reading\nOPINION\nThe U.S. Once Built Airplanes Quickly\nThe Score: Disney, Berkshire Hathaway, Ford and More Stocks That Defined the Week\nBritish Airways Owner IAG to Buy 53 Boeing and Airbus Planes Despite Market Uncertainty\nEurope Is Racing to Build Its Own Version of the U.S. Military-Industrial Complex\nChina Offers Olive Branch to U.S. Firms After Boeing Delivery Halt",

Chinese officials are moving to try to revitalize their economy and soften their rhetoric toward Washington. The U.S. and Ms. Yellen, meanwhile, are scrutinizing perceived national-security risks in Chinese technology, while also aiming to avoid undue harm to an engine of global economic growth. \n“Secretary Yellen has got a big challenge,” said Matt Goodman, senior vice president for economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. “That’s making the case for growth on one hand and on the other being forceful for the U.S. need to protect our national security.”\nA Treasury official said the department doesn’t view protecting national security and promoting global economic growth to be at odds with each other. Regular communication with Chinese officials can help accomplish both goals, the Treasury official said. \nThe U.S. last year imposed wide-ranging export controls on advanced semiconductors, a step aimed at hobbling China’s ability to develop its military capabilities.

Ms. Yellen, who has pushed for U.S. companies to become less reliant on China, is concerned that China could retaliate against the U.S. economy, according to people familiar with her thinking. If Chinese officials see U.S. policies as too punitive, they could cut off U.S. access to goods such as solar panels, for example. \n“The defense and intelligence agencies are frequently going to have more restrictive views on these questions than the Treasury,” said Mark Sobel, a former Treasury official who is the U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think tank. “Treasury’s macro-analysis well understands there are spillovers and spillbacks and interdependencies, and these are issues that need to be managed for the global economy.”\nChina’s Liu He previously encouraged the U.S. to relax its tariffs on the country’s goods. PHOTO: LEAH MILLIS/REUTERS\nTreasury officials, who have held a series of meetings with private-sector participants to discuss the possible investment controls on China, have sought to more narrowly target the White House order, according to people familiar with the matter. Outstanding questions include how many Chinese technology sectors would be subject to the controls, whether the government would outright ban investment in them and how investors would comply with the new rules, these people said.\nThe difficulty of resolving those questions has slowed progress on crafting the executive order, according to people familiar with the talks. \n“There’s not even consensus around how to scope this,” said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has studied export controls. \nThe Treasury Department is also leading a review into the U.S. operations of TikTok, which is owned by a Chinese parent company, at the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., an interagency government panel.

         "Yellen, Top Chinese Official to Meet, Try to Smooth Economic Ties Jan. 16, 500 am. ET 98 6 min. Treasury. Secretary. Janet. Yellen must weigh national-security risks in. Chinese technology while avoiding harm to an economic-growth engine. WASHINGTONU.S. Treasury. Secretary. Janet. Yellen will meet with senior. Chinese official. Liu. He this week as the two superpowers try to rekindle a relationship that accounts for much of the world's economic activity but has grown tense over technology access, trade policy and. Taiwan. The pair will meet. Wednesday in. Zurich, where. Ms. Yellen is stopping ahead of a multicountry tour through. Africa that is aimed in part at countering. China's influence on the , who is expected to step down from his post in. March but is close to. Chinese. President. Xi. Jinping, is expected to attend the. World. Economic. Forum in. Davos,. Switzerland. The two sides arranged to meet in a third country while they are both abroad. Senior. U.S. and. Chinese officials have only recently started meeting again after. China cut off most such communications following then-House. Speaker. Nancy. Pelosi's visit to. Taiwan last year. President. Biden and. Mr. Xi in. November agreed to resume contacts among top officials, and. Ms. Yellen is looking at traveling to. China after. Secretary of. State. Antony. Blinken visits next month, according to people familiar with the matter. U.S. officials have been unsure who. Ms. Yellen's next counterpart will be after a. Chinese government reshuffle. The renewed engagement comes as both countries try to recalibrate their relationship with their top geopolitical rivaland one of their closest economic partners. Chinese officials are moving to try to revitalize their economy and soften their rhetoric toward. Washington. The. U.S. and. Ms. Yellen, meanwhile, are scrutinizing perceived national-security risks in. Chinese technology, while also aiming to avoid undue harm to an engine of global economic growth. \"Secretary. Yellen has got a big challenge,\" said. Matt. Goodman, senior vice president for economics at the. Center for. Strategic and. International. Studies, a. Washington think tank. \"That's making the case for growth on one hand and on the other being forceful for the. U.S. need to protect our national security.\". A. Treasury official said the department doesn't view protecting national security and promoting global economic growth to be at odds with each other. Regular communication with. Chinese officials can help accomplish both goals, the. Treasury official said. The. U.S. last year imposed wide-ranging export controls on advanced semiconductors, a step aimed at hobbling. China's ability to develop its military capabilities. The. Biden administration is working on an executive order on screening. U.S. investment in certain. Chinese technology sectors, including advanced semiconductors. With both the export controls that are in place and the potential outbound investment restrictions, some. Treasury officials are concerned that the steps could slow. China's access to technology for ordinary commercial purposes as , who has pushed for. U.S. companies to become less reliant on. China, is concerned that. China could retaliate against the. U.S. economy, according to people familiar with her thinking. If. Chinese officials see. U.S. policies as too punitive, they could cut off. U.S. access to goods such as solar panels, for example. \"The defense and intelligence agencies are frequently going to have more restrictive views on these questions than the. Treasury,\" said. Mark. Sobel, a former. Treasury official who is the. U.S. chairman of the. Official. Monetary and. Financial. Institutions. Forum, a think tank. \"Treasury's macro-analysis well understands there are spillovers and spillbacks and interdependencies, and these are issues that need to be managed for the global economy.\". China's. Liu. He previously encouraged the. U.S. to relax its tariffs on the country's goods. Treasury officials, who have held a series of meetings with private-sector participants to discuss the possible investment controls on. China, have sought to more narrowly target the. White. House order, according to people familiar with the matter. Outstanding questions include how many. Chinese technology sectors would be subject to the controls, whether the government would outright ban investment in them and how investors would comply with the new rules, these people said. The difficulty of resolving those questions has slowed progress on crafting the executive order, according to people familiar with the talks. \"There's not even consensus around how to scope this,\" said. Martin. Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the. Peterson. Institute for. International. Economics who has studied export controls. The. Treasury. Department is also leading a review into the. U.S. operations of. TikTok, which is owned by a. Chinese parent company, at the. Committee on. Foreign. Investment in the. U.S., an interagency government panel. Treasury officials have warned against requiring the divestment of. TikTok's. U.S. operations as other. Biden administration officials have pushed for that option,. The. Journal has reported. What should the. U.S.-China relationship look like? Join the conversation below. After her meeting with. Mr. Liu,. Ms. Yellen will travel to. Senegal,. Zambia and. South. Africa. China has deepened its ties on the. African continent in recent years, lending to many low-income countries. Zambia has struggled to reach an agreement with its. Chinese creditors to restructure its has repeatedly criticized. China's behavior as a creditor as the. U.S. tries to bolster its own influence in. Africa. \"It seems like it's a form of catch-up here,\". Rama. Yade, senior director of the. Atlantic. Council's. Africa center, said of the. Biden administration's renewed outreach to. Africa. On trade,. Ms. Yellen has called for \"friendshoring,\" a term used to describe companies reorienting their supply chains into countries such as. India to be less dependent on. Chinadrawing criticism from. Chinese officials. But she has also pushed for the. U.S. to relax some of its tariffs on. Chinese goods. When. Ms. Yellen and. Mr. Liu spoke in a call over the summer,.

         "FTC Plan to Ban Noncompete Clauses Shifts Companies’ Focus\nBan could prompt employers to use alternative mechanisms such as nondisclosure agreements\nDaniel Bachhuber at his home office in Tualatin, Ore. MASON TRINCA FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nBy\nLauren Weber\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 17, 2023 10:39 am ET\n292\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(6 min)\nBusinesses and lawyers are beginning to assess what the Federal Trade Commission’s proposed ban of noncompete clauses in employment contracts could mean for worker mobility, wages and the way future compensation agreements are structured. \nWhile a full or partial ban could expand the pool of potential hires, it also would weaken a tool that employers have come to rely on to retain talent and protect trade secrets and other proprietary information, lawyers say. More companies likely would turn to a patchwork of alternative mechanisms to keep people from leaving and taking valuable information with them, including nondisclosure agreements and employment contracts that reward longevity, they say. \nTHE JOURNAL.\nCould This Be the End of Noncompetes?\n16:36\n1x\nSUBSCRIBE\nAdd to Queue\nExplore Audio Center\n“Employers have operated with an understanding that they can protect their interests through noncompetes,” said Matthew Durham, a Salt Lake City-based attorney with Dorsey & Whitney LLP who advises companies on employment matters. “What you’re seeing, reflected in the FTC proposal and elsewhere, is a growing hostility to the idea that there should be those kinds of restrictions, and it’s changing the environment that employers have been comfortable with in the last number of years.”\nThe FTC proposed a ban this month on nearly all noncompetes, saying that the clauses—which typically prohibit workers from moving to a new employer or starting new ventures of their own—hamper competition in the labor market, suppress wages and hold back innovation and entrepreneurship. The proposal came in response to an executive order from President Biden in 2021.\nBusinesses say they impose noncompete clauses on employees to protect trade secrets and other confidential information, including customer lists and financial data.\nThe FTC contends that noncompete clauses discourage innovation and entrepreneurship. PHOTO: ERIC LEE FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nMr. Durham and others say they believe the FTC may narrow its rule after hearing comments from the public, including employers and business organizations that have already signaled their opposition to the current proposal. The agency could, for example, allow noncompetes for highly compensated workers.\nNoncompetes are common in employment contracts for senior employees like software engineers, sales representatives and top executives. Over time, they have been applied to many parts of the U.S. workforce, including some janitors, baristas, schoolteachers and entry-level workers. According to the FTC, one in five U.S. workers is currently subject to a noncompete clause.\nNoncompetes are regulated at the state level, and many states have already taken action to limit use of the clauses by, in some cases, forbidding employers from imposing them on people earning under a particular wage threshold or for certain types of workers. \n“The vast majority of people in America can’t afford a lawyer to defend a noncompete case,” said Jonathan Pollard, an attorney in Florida who represents workers whose employers are trying to enforce noncompete clauses. “Just the threat of enforcement is often enough to restrain talent in the labor market.”\nThe Federal Trade Commission proposed a new ban on noncompete clauses, which the agency says hurts workers and competition. Companies argue they protect trade secrets. WSJ breaks down what a federal ban could mean for workers and businesses. Photo illustration: Jacob Reynolds\nSome states, such as California and Oklahoma, hold that the clauses are unenforceable in all or nearly all employment contracts. \nA number of studies suggest noncompetes suppress wages and innovation. A review of Oregon’s 2008 ban on noncompetes for hourly workers found that wages rose an average of 2% to 3%. Another study, examining Hawaii’s 2015 ban on noncompete agreements for high-tech workers, found an 11% increase in job moves and a 4% increase in new-hire salaries.\nThe clauses restrain not just pay and entrepreneurship, but also professional development, workers and some attorneys say. \nDaniel Bachhuber had worked as a software consultant for years when he decided to take an in-house job in the fall of 2018. His new employer required that he sign a one-year noncompete agreement, which he said was so broad it would have prevented him from practicing his core skills if he were to leave the company or be fired.\nMr. Bachhuber balked. Earlier in his career, he had been laid off a few weeks into a new job, just after his first child was born. If that happened at the new job, he recalled thinking, he would be unable to earn a living for a year. “I’m always thinking, worst case scenario, what kind of downstream protection do I have?” the 35-year-old said. “Even if I was employed just one day, I couldn’t go back to the same clients I had.”\nDaniel Bachhuber turned down a job after an employer wouldn’t change a noncompete clause. PHOTO: MASON TRINCA FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nHe consulted a lawyer and tried to renegotiate the contract, hoping to salvage a role that would have expanded his skills and given him a chance to work directly with the chief technology officer on special projects. The company declined to change the noncompete clause and, reluctantly, Mr. Bachhuber turned down the position. \nEmployers have other tools to protect information besides noncompete agreements, including nondisclosure agreements, trade secret laws and nonsolicitation agreements, which prohibit workers from poaching customers or employees of their prior firm. \nBut those tools generally can only be used after an employee violates the agreement, said Julie Levinson Werner, who represents employers as a partner with law firm Lowenstein Sandler LLP. “Once someone goes to another company, you’re really on the honor system. You have no way to monitor what information is being disclosed or not,” she said.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nDo you think noncompetes should be banned? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\nObservers on both sides say that limitations on the clauses will compel employers to get more creative about how they retain talent, using everything from compensation to career advancement to keep workers engaged and loyal to the company. Some companies use deferred compensation—such as retention bonuses or rolling stock options that vest after, say, three years—to give people incentives to stay.\n“Do you get better results with honey or vinegar?” said Ms. Werner. “If you want to motivate people and have them happy to stay, you have to look at compensation, the overall environment, how you treat them.”\nThe fate of the FTC’s final rule is up in the air. After a 60-day comment period, the commissioners will consider potential changes to the initial proposal and then issue a final rule. That rule will likely be challenged by business groups or individual companies, and courts will determine its trajectory, attorneys say.\nAdvertisement\nWrite to Lauren Weber at Lauren.Weber@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 18, 2023, print edition as 'Alternatives to Noncompete Clauses Sought'.\nSHOW CONVERSATION (292)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nSecret Purges, Tense Standoffs: The War Over Household Clutter\nMost Popular\nOPINION\nEuropean Navies Leave the U.S. High and Dry\nBirthright Citizenship Reaches the Supreme Court\nWelcome to the Post-Progressive Political Era\nUCLA Medical School and Racial Bias\nOne Cheer for the House Tax Bill\nFurther Reading\nDealmakers Are Struggling to Make Sense of Trump’s Antitrust Policy\nInside Mark Zuckerberg’s Failed Negotiations to End Antitrust Case\nZuckerberg, on Witness Stand, Rebuffs Claims Meta Monopolizes Social-Media Market\nStellantis to Revise Ads Saying Its Cars Are Built in America\nZuckerberg Lobbies Trump to Avoid Meta Antitrust Trial",

         "Advertisement\nU.S.\nLAW\nAs Cities Get Tough on Homelessness, Legal Battles Follow\nLawsuits across the U.S. call the policies cruel and counterproductive\nBy\nLaura Kusisto\nFollow\nJan. 17, 2023 9:00 am ET\n258\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(7 min)\nMental-health advocates in New York are challenging a plan to involuntarily send mentally ill homeless people to psychiatric hospitals. PHOTO: SPENCER PLATT/GETTY IMAGES\nCities across the U.S. have been introducing tougher measures to address the growing problem of homelessness, prompting a number of court challenges that could set guideposts on how far municipalities can go.\nLocal governments have been experimenting with a range of homeless policies, such as involuntarily removing people from the streets when they appear to be mentally ill, confiscating belongings or evicting the homeless from public property. City officials say the measures are necessary to address situations that are threatening public safety and leaving homeless people themselves living in conditions that are unsafe and unsanitary.\nRates of street homelessness around the country have been on the rise for more than a decade, driven in part by the skyrocketing cost of housing in many places. The challenges have been concentrated in large, often liberal, cities where officials are facing public calls for a more forceful approach to the problem.\nBut moves to take a tougher stance have prompted objections from homeless advocates who say the policies are cruel, counterproductive and often in violation of constitutional protections including the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments, the Fourth Amendment’s guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures and First Amendment protections for speech in public places. Some lawsuits also have alleged violations of federal laws protecting the disabled.\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams said the city would involuntarily take homeless individuals for psychiatric evaluation if deemed necessary.

         "U.S. Jan. 17, 900 am. ET 258 7 min. Mental-health advocates in. New. York are challenging a plan to involuntarily send mentally ill homeless people to psychiatric hospitals. Cities across the. U.S. have been introducing tougher measures to address the growing problem of homelessness, prompting a number of court challenges that could set guideposts on how far municipalities can go. Local governments have been experimenting with a range of homeless policies, such as involuntarily removing people from the streets when they appear to be mentally ill, confiscating belongings or evicting the homeless from public property. City officials say the measures are necessary to address situations that are threatening public safety and leaving homeless people themselves living in conditions that are unsafe and unsanitary. Rates of street homelessness around the country have been on the rise for more than a decade, driven in part cost of housing in many places. The challenges have been concentrated in large, often liberal, cities where officials are facing public calls for a more forceful approach to the problem. But moves to take a tougher stance have prompted objections from homeless advocates who say the policies are cruel, counterproductive and often in violation of constitutional protections including the. Eighth. Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments, the. Fourth. Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures and. First. Amendment protections for speech in public places. Some lawsuits also have alleged violations of federal laws protecting the disabled. New. York. Mayor. Eric.

Southwest canceled over 16,700 flights late last year after a severe winter storm tipped its operation into chaos, and its pilots have emerged as some of the airline's harshest critics. \"This decision is not one based on emotion, but. I would be lying if. I said that. I wasn't angry,\". Mr. Murray wrote. Wednesday. \"Our airline just suffered a loss of 825 million due to outdated technology and procedures.\". Southwest has said that the magnitude of the storm overwhelmed a crew scheduling system the airline uses, leaving it dependent on tedious manual processes that hampered its recovery. Chief. Executive. Bob. Jordan has acknowledged that the airline made missteps and has said it is taking steps to prevent a recurrence, including working to upgrade a crew scheduling system with new capabilities. It has also hired consultants to review what went wronga process. Mr. Jordan has said the airline's unions have been asked to join. It was a turbulent year for carriers in . But. Southwest's holiday meltdown stands out. So how much did the cancellations, lost bags and complaints affect the company's place in. WSJ's annual airline rankings? Illustration. Jon. Krause. U.S. labor laws make airline strikes difficult and rare. The last time. U.S. passenger airline pilots went on strike was at. Spirit. Airlines. Inc. in . Southwest's pilots asked government mediators to step in and oversee their negotiation last year. For a strike to go forward, the. National. Mediation. Board would first have to agree that talks have reached an impasse and would then offer both sides a chance to arbitrate their dispute. If either refused, there would be a 30-day cooling off period. While any strike could be months away, if it happens at all, the union hinted at the possibility for disruption, writing that it would schedule its vote in. May to give. Southwest customers more time to plan. Southwest is not alone in facing acrimonious talks with pilots. Several major carriers have struggled to come to terms with pilot groups in the past year as unions have sought not only better pay but also changes to scheduling practices, protections for time off and other changes they have said are needed to address disruptions the industry faced in its race to meet growing travel demand the past two years. last year voted overwhelmingly to authorize union leaders to call a strike if they deemed it necessarysimilar to the measure.

Ryan Barber\n,\nAruna Viswanatha\nand\nSadie Gurman\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(6 min)\nRobert Hur is a Justice Department veteran with experience in the George W. Bush and Donald Trump administrations, including as U.S. attorney for Maryland. PHOTO: MICHAEL MCCOY/REUTERS\nWASHINGTON—Weeks after adding the National Football League as a client, former prosecutor Robert Hur received a call from Attorney General Merrick Garland asking him to serve as the special counsel overseeing the investigation into classified documents found at a home and former office of President Biden. It was a request Mr. Hur told associates he didn’t feel he could refuse, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMr. Hur accepted the appointment clear-eyed about the reputational risks of taking on an investigation into a sitting president, according to people familiar with his considerations, especially as a separate special counsel investigates former President Donald Trump over his handling of classified documents found at his South Florida residence and private club, Mar-a-Lago.\nMr. Hur is expected to begin as special counsel at the end of January after winding down his work at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, the law firm he joined as a partner in 2021 after serving as the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Maryland. For Mr. Hur, the appointment entails leaving behind what promised to be a lucrative client in the NFL, which had turned to him to defend against a lawsuit brought by the Washington, D.C., attorney general.\n“This was clearly not a financially motivated decision,” said Rod Rosenstein, who served as deputy attorney general during the Trump administration and assigned Mr. Hur, at the time his top aide, to help oversee Robert Mueller’s special counsel inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. “Rob understands what he is getting into,” Mr. Rosenstein said. \nPresident Biden said Thursday that a “small number” of classified documents from his time as vice president were found at his home and in his personal library. Attorney General Merrick Garland outlined the decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate.

In a statement, Gibson Dunn partner F. Joseph Warin said Mr. Hur “has excelled in every professional endeavor, and we are confident that he will discharge his responsibilities as Special Counsel with the same impeccable judgment and tireless work ethic that he has exhibited throughout his career.”\nIn Mr. Hur, the attorney general picked a Justice Department veteran with experience in the George W. Bush and Trump administrations and political savvy, former colleagues said. During his tenure as U.S. attorney for Maryland, Mr. Hur’s office handled several high-profile cases and secured a conviction against former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh on fraud and tax charges.\nMr. Hur’s return to the Justice Department comes just weeks after he entered his initial court appearance to defend the NFL and its commissioner, Roger Goodell, against a consumer-protection lawsuit alleging that the league and the Washington Commanders team deceived Washington, D.C., residents about their investigation into a “toxic workplace culture that impacted employees, especially women.”\nThe Washington attorney general’s office accuses the league of misleading the public by withholding the full findings of that investigation, which the team initiated before the league took over the inquiry. The league, the attorney general’s office said, had made promises of a transparent and independent investigation. \nAn NFL spokesman said when the lawsuit was filed in November that it was “legally unsound and factually baseless” and defended the league’s investigation.\nNational Football League commissioner Roger Goodell is a defendant in a lawsuit in which Robert Hur had been set to represent him.

That could include more invasive steps such as having the Federal Bureau of Investigation, rather than Mr. Biden’s legal team, search the president’s properties for additional documents, they said. \nAfter the initial discovery of classified documents in November, the Justice Department considered having agents monitor a search by Mr. Biden’s lawyers for the material but decided against it, in part to preserve their freedom to take a tougher line later, including by executing a future search warrant, if negotiations ever turned hostile, people familiar with the matter said. The approach signaled that investigators are considering the possibility of a grand jury investigation into the matter.\nMr. Hur also could ask Mr. Biden’s team for consent to have the FBI search the homes and office themselves, a step law-enforcement officials have already discussed, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Trump, for his part, has continued to argue that the revelations about the Justice Department’s stance toward Mr. Biden point to a bias against him, considering how his home was subject to an August FBI search. “Why aren’t they raiding his house?” the former president wrote Wednesday on his social media platform. \nIn an effort to explain the discovery of empty folders marked classified at his property, he said they were distributed in the Oval Office, and while the papers inside were collected after review, the folders weren’t. “I saved hundreds of them,” Mr. Trump wrote, adding he viewed the folders as a “cool keepsake.” \nInvestigators say they retrieved hundreds of pages of documents from Mr. Trump’s property in a search that followed months of government attempts to get the records back and Mr. Trump’s legal team failing to fully comply with a May subpoena.\nThe political risks to Mr. Biden were evident in a new Quinnipiac University poll, with 60% of respondents saying the president acted inappropriately in the way he handled the documents.

         "Boeing Bets on Experimental Jetliner Flight in 2028 4 min won a. NASA-backed contest to build a prototype of a new, fuel-efficient jetliner that officials said the company aims to fly for the first time in . The plane the aerospace giant plans to develop would install longer, thinner wings supported from below on a single-aisle fuselage, a design that officials said would cut down on fuel needs. The. National. Aeronautics and. Space. Administration didn't disclose the names of rivals who participated in its competition, which was aimed at kick-starting the development of more environmentally friendly aircraft. Boeing executives and. NASA leaders on. Wednesday described the plane as experimental, with multiple technical challenges to resolve before the inaugural demonstration flight several years from now. The planned jet won't necessarily become part of the lineup that. Boeing manufactures and sells, executives from the company said. In. November,. Boeing. Chief. Executive. David. Calhoun said he had pushed back plans for the company to create its own new plane until the s. A weekly must-read of news, analysis and exclusive data focused on the intersection of business, money and climate. \"This is really to have confidence in technology to enable it to be considered for commercialization,\". Boeing technology chief. Todd. Citron said of the prototype jet. The company is looking to see if the benefits match predictions for the plane, he said \"That would be the precursor for then consideration on a commercial product.\". The aviation industry has faced mounting pressure from governments and airline customers to address its contribution to climate change, spurring manufacturers to roll out strategies to try to mitigate emissions from planes. NASA. Administrator. Bill. Nelson said the agency created the competition as the private sector wasn't prepared to take on all of the risk alone. Boeing's planned jet is funded with a 425 million. NASA contribution over seven years, and 725 million from the company and its partners. The planned. Boeing jet's long, thin wings would be delicate and need support struts to reduce the stress where they join the body. NASA and. Boeing must also study operational issues on the prototype jet, such as deicing wings and fueling the plane, said. Bob. Pearce, associate administrator at. NASA for its aeronautics research unit. A group of almost 300 airlines have committed to 'net zero' carbon emissions by , but just how are they going to get there? WSJ's. George. Downs explores some of the methods the. International. Air.

Dispatchers working from airlines’ operations centers review them for important information that could affect flights. Pilots are required to review the alerts before taking off.\nFAA staff and former agency leaders, as well as some elected officials and air safety advocates, have for years warned about older technology the agency relies on to manage operations in U.S. airspace.

NFLX 1.51%\nincrease; green up pointing triangle\nflight attendant to work on the company’s private jet. Asking salary: As much as $385,000.\nIn a time of downsizing at many top tech companies, Netflix set the internet abuzz this week with what some described as an unusual job listing. The streaming company wants a trained flight attendant to be in charge of trips on its super midsize jet, according to the posting on its website. The employee must have outstanding customer service skills and safety training.\nThe pay range for the role is listed as $60,000 to $385,000, depending on the person’s background, according to Netflix. By comparison, the median flight attendant annual salary in 2021 was about $61,000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nNetflix didn’t return requests for comment.\nThe job listing went viral. “Where do I apply?!” was a common refrain. Some social-media users couldn’t believe the wide pay range, a likely effect of new pay-transparency disclosure laws enacted recently in several states including California, where Netflix is based.\nOthers were surprised Netflix was advertising the role at all, as the company has been focused on reining in spending. Last year Netflix posted two consecutive quarters of subscriber losses for the first time in its history and laid off hundreds of employees. But the year ended with what the company called a “brighter finish,” as Netflix beat its own forecast for subscriber gains in the fourth quarter. \nAs interest rates rise and companies tighten their belts, white-collar workers have taken the brunt of layoffs and job cuts, breaking with the usual pattern leading into a downturn. WSJ explains why many professionals are getting the pink slip first. Illustration: Adele Morgan\nFor some flight attendants, the biggest surprise was the potential paycheck. Lauren Pires, a corporate flight attendant based in Miami, said she has never heard of anyone in her industry who has made $385,000.\n“This has to be quite, quite the position to be at this salary,” said Ms. Pires, who has worked on private jets for over a decade. She said a lot of corporate flight attendants make six figures but not as much as the maximum pay on the Netflix listing.\nThe job asks the new hire to balance a highflying life on its Gulfstream G550 jet charter trips with the mundane.\nNetflix’s corporate aircraft services are available to some executives and their families and guests for personal use, according to the company. “Consider amounts related to such travel as a perquisite,” the company’s compensation disclosure says.\nA private jet trip is a common perk at some big companies, often for security reasons.\n“The aviation team helps Netflix reach the world more efficiently and effectively so the company can continue to create joy around the world,” according to the job posting, which noted that the recruit will be based near Netflix’s Silicon Valley headquarters.\nThe flight attendant should be capable of standing for long periods, helping with loading baggage, purchasing and loading aircraft stock before a trip. The person, who will join a team of attendants, must also be a self-starter: “The flight attendant will need to operate with little direction and a lot of self-motivation,” according to the job posting.\nNetflix’s corporate aircraft services are available to some executives and their families and guests for personal use.

Corporate flight attendants sometimes don’t know where they are about to fly when they show up to work.\nMs. Pires, the corporate flight attendant, said her peers on private jets often work solo with more than a dozen passengers. Their jobs are demanding. They are responsible for upholding safety precautions, sourcing meal ingredients, cooking food, cleaning the aircraft and waiting on wealthy clients.\n“We’re not flying the aircraft but we’re doing everything so that these clients can be happy on these aircrafts,” said Ms. Pires, who is also the executive director of VVIP International, a Miami-based company that trains corporate flight attendants and staffs private flights.\nShe said passengers have asked corporate flight attendants to pick up items at Saks Fifth Avenue or to find caviar or pricey bottles of Don Julio 1942 tequila.\nGiven the requirements in the Netflix job description, the company’s new flight attendant would likely need to be experienced and available to work around the clock to get top pay, Ms. Pires said.\nLauren Pires of VVIP International.

The employee must have outstanding customer service skills and safety training. The pay range for the role is listed as 60,000 to 385,000, depending on the person's background, according to. Netflix. By comparison, the median flight attendant annual salary in was about 61,000, according to the. U.S. Bureau of. Labor. Statistics. Netflix didn't return requests for comment. The job listing went viral. \"Where do. I apply?!\" was a common refrain. Some social-media users couldn't believe the wide pay range, a likely effect of new pay-transparency disclosure laws enacted recently in several states including. California, where. Netflix is based. Others were surprised. Netflix was advertising the role at all, as the company has been focused on reining in spending. Last year. Netflix posted two consecutive quarters of subscriber losses for the first time in its history and laid off hundreds of employees. But the year ended with what the company called a \"brighter finish,\" as. Netflix beat its own forecast for subscriber gains in the fourth quarter. As interest rates rise and companies tighten their belts, white-collar workers have taken the brunt of layoffs and job cuts, breaking with the usual pattern leading into a downturn. WSJ explains why many professionals are getting the pink slip first. Illustration. Adele. Morgan. For some flight attendants, the biggest surprise was the potential paycheck. Lauren. Pires, a corporate flight attendant based in. Miami, said she has never heard of anyone in her industry who has made 385,000. \"This has to be quite, quite the position to be at this salary,\" said. Ms. Pires, who has worked on private jets for over a decade. She said a lot of corporate flight attendants make six figures but not as much as the maximum pay on the. Netflix listing. The job asks the new hire to balance a highflying life on its. Gulfstream. G550 jet charter trips with the mundane. Netflix's corporate aircraft services are available to some executives and their families and guests for personal use, according to the company. \"Consider amounts related to such travel as a perquisite,\" the company's compensation disclosure says. A private jet trip is a common perk at some big companies, often for security reasons. \"The aviation team helps. Netflix reach the world more efficiently and effectively so the company can continue to create joy around the world,\" according to the job posting, which noted that the recruit will be based near. Netflix's. Silicon. Valley headquarters. The flight attendant should be capable of standing for long periods, helping with loading baggage, purchasing and loading aircraft stock before a trip. The person, who will join a team of attendants, must also be a self-starter \"The flight attendant will need to operate with little direction and a lot of self-motivation,\" according to the job posting. Netflix's corporate aircraft services are available to some executives and their families and guests for personal use. The position would likely not have much job security or scheduling protections, said. Sara. Nelson, the president of the. Association of. Flight. Attendants-CWA, which represents 50,000 flight attendants. Corporate flight attendants sometimes don't know where they are about to fly when they show up to work. Ms. Pires, the corporate flight attendant, said her peers on private jets often work solo with more than a dozen passengers. Their jobs are demanding. They are responsible for upholding safety precautions, sourcing meal ingredients, cooking food, cleaning the aircraft and waiting on wealthy clients. \"We're not flying the aircraft but we're doing everything so that these clients can be happy on these aircrafts,\" said. Ms. Pires, who is also the executive director of. VVIP. International, a. Miami-based company that trains corporate flight attendants and staffs private flights. She said passengers have asked corporate flight attendants to pick up items at. Saks. Fifth. Avenue or to find caviar or pricey bottles of. Don. Julio tequila. Given the requirements in the. Netflix job description, the company's new flight attendant would likely need to be experienced and available to work around the clock to get top pay,. Ms. Pires said. Lauren. Pires of. VVIP. International. The bottom end of the posted salary range for the position is 60,000. Netflix likely posted the range to comply with. California's new salary transparency law, which requires most employers to list pay on job postings. New. York. City and. Washington state have similar laws. Some employers have posted broad pay ranges to comply with the law, leaving some applicants questioning how useful the requirement is. Netflix co-Chief. Executive. Reed. Hastings, who the company said. Thursday would transition to executive chairman, has long championed transparency as key to the company's culture. And the streaming company has historically given employees broader access to corporate information than many publicly traded companies. But it is now restricting the ability of some staff to see other employees' salary information,. The. Wall. Street. Journal reported earlier this month. What do you think of pay disclosures in job postings? Join the conversation below. Christine. Hendrickson, the vice president of strategic initiatives at. Syndio. Inc., a workplace analytics platform, said companies sometimes post wide salary ranges when they are hiring for positions at different levels or trying to account for applicants from high-cost or low-cost living areas. Netflix, for example, has a separate listing for a software engineer who would either work remotely or be based in. Silicon. Valley. The salary range between 90,000 and 900,000. Secret. Purges,.

Tim Kaine of Virginia, pictured Friday in Richmond, was first elected to the Senate in 2012. PHOTO: JOHN C. CLARK/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said he would run for a third term, providing his party a boost ahead of what is expected to be a tough 2024 campaign to keep control of the chamber. \n“I’m a servant, I love Virginia, I’m proud of what I’ve done, and I’ve got a whole lot more I want to do,” he said at a press conference in Richmond, Va. \nMr. Kaine, 64 years old, served as mayor of Richmond, and later as Virginia’s governor. He was first elected to the Senate in 2012 and won re-election in 2018. His profile was elevated in 2016 when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton chose him to be her vice presidential running mate. \nWhile Virginia is considered a competitive state, Mr. Kaine handily won re-election by a 15-point margin in 2018 against Republican Corey Stewart, a former Prince William County executive. Democrat Joe Biden won the presidential race by 10 points in 2020, but the state elected Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Lt. Gov.

Ms. Sears and state Attorney General Jason Miyares could also look at the Senate or governor race. Some House Republicans could pursue statewide office, such as freshman Rep. Jen Kiggans. \nThe Democratic caucus, which includes three independents who align with the party, currently has a 51-49 majority in the Senate. But Democrats are defending far more seats than Republicans in 2024. Earlier this month, Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D., Mich.) said she won’t seek re-election, potentially easing the way for Republicans to flip that seat.\nDemocrats breathed a sigh of relief that Mr. Kaine was running for another term, after he had held off on committing to another run and as he continues to suffer long-term symptoms from Covid-19. He said party leaders encouraged him to run again.\nHe said that despite the split control of Congress, he could see some progress on immigration laws, mental health and addiction.\n“Is it going to be tougher the next couple of years? Yes, it will be,” he said at his press conference. “But are there meaningful things that can be done and done in a bipartisan way? I believe so,” he said.\nMr. Kaine has been a reliable Democratic vote in the Senate. In his announcement, he touted his work on transportation projects such as highway improvements and the Metro Silver Line in Northern Virginia, as well as his work on foreign affairs and helping military families and veterans.\nIn recent months, he opposed efforts by Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) to push through a provision approving the Mountain Valley Pipeline in West Virginia and Virginia as part of his stalled permitting overhaul proposal. He has worked with Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) on compromise legislation that would codify the rights to abortion recognized in the now-defunct 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and related rulings. Mr. Kaine personally opposes abortion but supports abortion access.\nMr. Kaine is a fluent Spanish speaker, and back in 2016 the Clinton campaign hoped he could help mobilize Latino voters. During his first address as running mate, he switched between English and Spanish and described himself as a progressive, reacting to criticism from the party’s left wing that he was a pro-business centrist who was too open to trade deals. \nMr. Kaine also noted his perfect election record. “I’m 8-0 and I promise you I’m not about to let that change,” he said.

PHOTO: ANNE KAURANEN/REUTERS\nShares in the owner of the “Angry Birds” mobile game franchise soared Friday after it said it had received a 751 million euro takeover proposal, equivalent to $813.5 million, from a rival developer, as a slowdown in the games industry spurs consolidation.\nRovio Entertainment Oyj, which helped pioneer the mobile-gaming industry, said the 9.05 euro-a-share bid from Israel’s Playtika PLTK -0.50%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\nHolding Corp. represented a sweetened offer, following an earlier, undisclosed 8.50 euro bid from the company.\nThe Finnish company said it wasn’t presently engaged in talks with Playtika but would evaluate the proposal and determine how to proceed. Rovio’s shares jumped 40% in early trading to 7.96 euros, before falling back slightly.\nPlaytika specializes in casino-style mobile games, though it has recently added casual games akin to “Angry Birds” to its stable through a series of acquisitions.\nIn a statement, Playtika said it believed the combination of Rovio’s intellectual property and user base, together with its monetization and game operation capabilities, would create value for shareholders.\nSimple yet addictive, “Angry Birds” was a trailblazing mobile game released in 2009 when smartphones and the mobile-gaming industry they enabled were still in their infancy.

It floated on the stock market in late 2017, hoping the listing would help its growth plans.\nHowever, Rovio has never managed to replicate the success of “Angry Birds” with its subsequent games titles and the aging franchise, while still popular, has itself been eclipsed in recent years by newer rivals.\nEven so, Rovio had a relatively strong 2022, reporting a 16% increase in revenues to 241 million euros in the first nine months of the year relative to the same period in 2021.

Mobile games account for half of all videogame revenues, and are worth as much as console, PC and online videogames combined, according to Newzoo.\nThe slowdown has helped drive a wave of consolidation in the industry, most notably in Microsoft Corp.’s proposed $75 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc.  \nPlaytika announced in December that it was laying off around 600 employees, equivalent to 15% of its total head count.\nDominic Chopping contributed to this article.\nAdvertisement\nWrite to Trefor Moss at Trefor.Moss@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 21, 2023, print edition as '‘Angry Birds’ Owner Rovio Receives Takeover Proposal'.\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nUnitedHealth Group Is Under Criminal Investigation for Medicare Fraud\nBags of Cash From Drug Cartels Flood Teller Windows at U.S. Banks\nThe U.S. Nuclear Base Hidden Under Greenland’s Ice for Decades\nWarren Buffett Reveals He Stepped Down After Finally Feeling His Age\nThey Paid $3,500 for Apple’s Vision Pro.

SPACs is over? Why or why not? Join the conversation below. Because investors don't know what type of deal a. SPAC will do, they are allowed to pull their money out before mergers get completed. During the boom two years ago, such withdrawals were rare because shares of the companies were surging. Investors elected to either hold shares of the newly public startup or sell to lock in a profit. Now, with the market struggling, most investors are electing to withdraw their money, leaving the company going public with less cash to grow its business and making such mergers less appealing. At their peak,. SPACs accounted for 70 of all. IPOs, with 95 billion raised. But now, the market has dried up and shares of companies that did. SPAC deals have crashed. WSJ explains the decline of the. IPO vehicle. Illustration. Ali. Larkin. SPACs typically have two years to do a deal or they must return cash to investors and the creators forfeit the money they spent to set up the. SPAC, normally around 10 million. More of those liquidations have occurred in recent weeks than happened in the entire market's history, fueling losses for creators above 1 billion. Because creators can make millions if they complete a deal, some analysts expect the trend of more muted mergers to continue. \"Everyone is just trying to keep their heads above water,\" said.
