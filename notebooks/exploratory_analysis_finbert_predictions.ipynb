The president believes his legacy is the color green. As nations use more and more supposedly cheap solar and wind power, a strange thing happens. Our power bills get more expensive. This exposes the environmentalist lie that renewables have already outmatched fossil fuels and that the \"green transition\" is irreversible even under a second. Trump administration. The claim that green energy is cheaper relies on bogus math that measures the cost of electricity only when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing. Modern societies need around-the-clock power, requiring backup, often powered . That means we're paying for two power systems renewables and backup. Moreover, as fossil fuels are used less, those power sources need to earn their capital costs back in fewer hours, leading to even more expensive power.

Lively, which sells easy-to-use cellphones and has said it would provide an update about service issues on. Thursday. When. Teresa. Kurtz's 78-year-old mother accidentally locked herself out of her home last week in. Cedar. Rapids,. Iowa, she pulled out her. Jitterbug flip phone to seek help, only to discover no calls would go through. \"This was one little instance where it's like, oh my gosh, this is her lifeline,\" said. Ms. Kurtz, 60, about her mother, who lives alone and faced chilly temperatures before receiving help from a neighbor. Lively service, which sells easy-to-use cellphones and medical-alert devices to mostly older people. The company's. Jitterbug. Flip phone stopped working for some customers after the start of the new year following the planned shutdown of. Verizon. Communications. Inc.'s. VZ 2.02 increase; green up pointing triangle 3G network on. Dec. 31. \"As a result of network updates made on. Jan. 2, some customers with a. Jitterbug.

Jitterbug. Flip2 phones,. Jitterbug smartphones and. Lively-branded devices aren't impacted. In a message to affected customers,. Lively said it expects to provide an update by. Thursday. It didn't give an estimate of when service would be restored or how many customers had issues with their devices. Lively told those customers to use a different device to contact 911 in the case of an emergency. \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our customers, and as soon as we learned about the issue, we worked to notify customers that were potentially impacted,\". Best. Buy said. After discovering service problems,. Ms. Kurtz said she and her mother thought there was an issue with the phone battery or the bill not being paid. After a few days, she said she called. Lively and got a recorded message about the. Jitterbug phone issue. She ordered a new phone for her mother and is switching her to another wireless provider, she said. Family members of. Lively customers said the company has offered new phones free in some instances, or discounts on purchasing upgraded devices. Last year, all three major. U.S. cellular carriers shut down their older 3G networks to free up more wireless spectrum for the build-out of 5G. The majority of. U.S. cellphone users have access to 4G or 5G networks, though some older models continued to depend on 3G right up until carriers shut down those networks. Apple. Inc.'s iPhone 4S, released more than a decade ago, was the last one the company produced that solely connected on 3G or older networks. Best. Buy acquired. Lively, formerly named. GreatCall, in for 800 million in cash. The service at that time had 900,000 paying subscribers and offered \"easy-to-use mobile products and connected devices tailored for aging consumers.\". Lively is known as a mobile virtual network operator, or. MVNO, which buys wholesale access to a wireless network instead of owning and operating it. For major wireless carriers, such arrangements let them sell excess capacity on their networks and gain customers without having to bear the costs of marketing to them or signing them up. Carriers generally don't discuss wholesale agreements or even acknowledge which services run on their networks. Lively's marketing materials say it is powered by \"the nation's most reliable wireless network,\" language that. Verizon used in its own wireless marketing for years. Verizon initially planned to shut down its 3G network in but extended the deadline until just before the calendar turned to , months after rivals closed similar systems. Some trade groups petitioned carriers to delay network shutdowns amid concerns of impacts for certain equipment such as security and medical alert systems and phone service for. Americans. The extension was \"an effort to minimize potential service disruptions and provide additional time for our customers to transition to newer and more advanced technologies and devices,\" a. Verizon spokesman said. \"We've had no significant network issues related to this transition and shutdown.\". A spokesman for the. Federal. Communications. Commission declined to comment on the. Lively situation. The. FCC has issued consumer warnings about the 3G shutdown and advised users to contact their mobile carrier ahead of time to determine whether service could be impacted. Some. Jitterbug users were unaware of any coming changes to service related to 3G network shutdowns, according to their family members. Dena. Bisnette of. Newton,. Kan., said she had heard last year about the shutdown of the 3G network, and called. Lively to ask if it would affect her. Jitterbug flip phone. A company representative told her the flip phone could be reprogrammed for 4G, she said, but her phone stopped working last said she ordered an upgraded. Jitterbug. Flip2 phone. For 96-year-old. Marjorie. Rees, her. Jitterbug flip phone is how she reaches loved ones from her retirement community, which doesn't provide landline service for residents, one of her family members said. \"I'm really at wits end, her phone just goes directly to voice mail when you call,\" said her son. Christopher. Rees, 58, of. Fredericksburg,. Texas. He has tried. Lively customer service, but they gave him similar information that is posted on the website and no explanation of the problem or how to fix it. \"She is agitated and worried that she is going to miss a phone call,\" he said. \"For my mom's sake,.

         "Proposed plan would allow low earners to pay less and wipe out college debt more quickly",
         "politics",
         "Biden. Administration. Plans to. Ease. Rules for. Income-Based. Student-Loan. Forgiveness. Gabriel. T. Rubin. Jan. 10, 500 am. ET 6 min. Income-driven repayment plans were designed to help lower earners borrow for college, but few have been able to use them effectively. The. Biden administration on. Tuesday released a detailed plan that will make it easier for student-loan holders to wipe out their debts using income-driven repayment plans. The proposed rule from the. Education. Department is a key step in overhauling the 1.6 trillion federal loan program that has left millions with ballooning debts. The administration first announced the change in. August when it unveiled its plan to cancel up to 20,000 in student debt for qualifying borrowers. The. Supreme. Court plans next month to take up a challenge to that broader debt-forgiveness, which is frozen after being blocked . New. Student-Debt. Plan. Would. Benefit. Lower-Income. Borrowers 0744 1x. Income-driven repayment plans were designed to help lower earners borrow for college, but few have been able to use them effectively because of technical problems and onerous amounts of income-verification paperwork. If enacted, the proposed changes would provide qualifying borrowers with significantly more-generous options that could leave them debt-free sooner, while paying off only a fraction of their total loan balances. To prevent student-debt balances from ballooning in the future, the administration plans to halve, to 5 from 10, the amount of discretionary income borrowers must pay each month on their undergraduate loans if they are enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan. Borrowers with incomes below 225 of the federal poverty line wouldn't have to make monthly payments on their loans. The administration estimated that that level corresponds to an individual income of less than roughly 30,600 annually or any borrower in a family of four who makes less than about 62,400 a year. What do you think of the. Biden. Administration's plan to overhaul income-driven repayment programs for student loans? Join the conversation below. Borrower loan balances won't grow as long as they make their monthly payments, even if a low-income borrower's monthly requirement is set at 0. The change would also forgive loan balances for people enrolled in income-based plans after 10 years of payments, down from 20 under many of the current options, for borrowers whose original loan balances were 12,000 or less. \"We are, for the first time, creating a student-loan safety net in this country,\" said. Education. Department. Undersecretary. James. Kvaal. The proposed rule now must go through a 30-day public-comment period, after which the department can release a final rule. Borrowers and members of both parties in. Congress have criticized the existing income-driven repayment program as broken. A government watchdog report last year found that only 157 borrowers out of eight million enrolled in the program successfully had their debt forgiven after decades of payments. The program has existed since . In its regulatory notice, the administration acknowledged that the plan would lead to \"increased costs of the student loan programs to the taxpayers in the form of transfers to borrowers who would pay less on their loans.\". Some opponents of debt relief, including congressional. Republicans, have criticized that arrangement as unfair to taxpayers who didn't take out loans or who paid them off in full. Payment-plan changes could, over time, be nearly as costly as the mass debt-cancellation plan is projected to be. A. University of. Pennsylvania. Wharton. School model suggested a range of possible price tags for the changes to income-driven repayment ranging from around 70 billion over 10 years to 450 billion over a longer period, depending on enrollment, and whether colleges continue to raise costs. The shortened repayment period for borrowers with less than 12,000 in debt could make some degree-granting programs, especially at community colleges, effectively free, according to some analysts. A. Biden plan to provide free community college was nixed in spending talks with congressional. Democrats. Many borrowers already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will be closer to debt forgiveness under changes announced administration last year. \"Based on how much typical community-college students pay for college and earn after graduation, it would allow a great many of them to be payment-free for 10 years, or close to it,\" wrote. Kevin. Carey, a higher-education expert at the nonpartisan. New. America. Foundation, in a. December analysis of the income-driven repayment plan based on the details the administration released last year. According to a fact sheet released. Tuesday, the. Department estimates that 85 of community-college borrowers would be debt free within 10 years of entering repayment. To cut down on the paperwork that discourages many borrowers from signing up or remaining enrolled in payment programs, the administration aims to automate much of the process, in part the. Internal. Revenue. Service to verify borrower incomes each year. Many borrowers already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans will be closer to debt forgiveness under changes announced last year. Borrowers who went into forbearancea temporary payment freeze where interest continues to build upfor at least 36 months between. July and. March will receive at least three years of payment credit when payments resume later this year. The. Education. Department said it would fix a longstanding problem where loan payments made to different servicers weren't counted together, which can lead to undercounting of payments that qualify for eventual forgiveness. Those changes are likely to affect around 3.6 million borrowers, or nearly 10 of all holders of federal student loans. Payments and interest accrual on federal student loans have been frozen since the start of the pandemic in. March . They are now scheduled to resume 60 days after litigation over the loan-forgiveness program is resolved or the program is implemented. The. U.S. Nuclear. Base. Hidden. Under. Greenland's. Ice for.

         "economy",
         "How. Far. Is. China's. Slowdown. Spreading? Ask a. Dairy. Farmer 6,000. Miles. Away. Milk has historically been viewed as a luxury in. China. Photographs for. The. Wall. Street. Journal 7 minutes. OTOROHANGA,. New. ZealandAs the sunrise cast a pink glow around 630 a.m.,. Michael and. Susie. Woodward worked together to attach suction cups to the udders of dozens of cows in the milking shed of their. New. Zealand dairy farm. When a tanker arrived to take the milk to a processor,. Michael. Woodward calculated the day's earningsand figured he and his wife would lose about 25 on the shipment. \"I try not to think about it, to be honest,\". Michael. Woodward, 43 years old, said as nearly 1,400 gallons of unprofitable milk was transferred from a storage vat to the truck. \"If you dwelled on it, you wouldn't be in a good space.\". Their troubles show the global impact of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy this year. China has been struggling to revive growth after an initial bounce from its. Covid-19 reopening fizzled, as consumers who initially spent on traveling and dining out curtailed spending. Its prolonged real-estate downturn has hit demand for iron ore, copper and other commodities, pressuring global prices and sapping export earnings for major producers in. Latin. America and. Australia. The value of. China's imports, including consumer products, fell 6.2 in. September compared with the same month last year. Everything from cosmetics to cars to dairy has taken a hit. In. New. Zealand, the world's biggest dairy exporter, farmers are now feeling the pain. As is the case with other countries,. New. Zealand's economy has become more intertwined with. China's because of the country's heft and strong growth in recent decades. To meet demand from its expanding middle class,. China imports billions of dollars of dairy products each year, with. New. Zealand sending more than 30 of its dairy exports . But. Chinese demand for milk, which historically has been viewed as a bit of a luxury, has also slumped amid the economic slowdown, as. Chinese dairy companies have been ramping up production. The resulting supply glut has reduced. China's need to get milk from overseas. One measure of. New. Zealand's dairy exports to. China, which includes fresh milk, milk powder, butter and cheese, fell 31. September compared with the same month last year. The weak demand from. China is driving dairy prices lower. They are now down nearly 40 compared with. March last year. A few weeks ago, they were down nearly 50. \"That's a big hit,\" said. Jim van der. Poel, chairman of. DairyNZ, an industry group. \"The milk that. China is not buying is only finding a home at lower prices.\". New. Zealand dairy companies have exported more of certain products to other markets recently, including some countries in the. Middle. East and. Southeast. Asia. But. China's continued role in driving global dairy prices is highlighting the economic pitfalls of being so closely tied to one big buyerand how hard it can be to diversify. Farmers in. New. Zealand are now cutting costs as they try to adjust. Those who took out hefty loans to buy their farms in recent years are struggling the mostparticularly as interest rates rise. Post-Covid inflationary pressures have increased the costs for labor, materials, spare parts and transport. Susie. Woodward, right, said that the family can't keep piling on debt at their dairy farm. The. Woodwards bought their farm, tucked in the rolling hills and green pastures of. New. Zealand's. Waikato region, about four years ago. The family owes about 2 million tied to the farm and equipment, and they are aiming to keep their overall losses this season to about 30,000. To do that, they have cut back on fertilizer and are using more of the milk they produce to sustain their calves instead of buying expensive feed. They are putting off big purchases, such as equipment to make the milking process more automated. The couple, who have four children, said their lender agreed to allow them to pay only interest on their loans for now. \"We want something here for generations,\". Susie. Woodward said, as she stood on a hill looking across the farm. \"But if it continues to be really tough and tight, then we have to start thinking about, 'What do we do?'. We can't keep piling on debt and the banks are only going to carry on with you for so long.\". One of. New. Zealand's big dairy exports is whole-milk powder, which is used in beverages, yogurts, ice cream and other food products. But with lackluster demand from consumers,. China's domestic producers converted much of their surplus fresh milk into powder to give it an extended shelf life, reducing demand for imports. In the third quarter, the value of. New. Zealand whole-milk powder exports to. China fell about 40 compared with the same quarter last year, government figures show. New. Zealand, the world's biggest dairy exporter, sends more than 30 of its dairy exports. China, but the demand for imported milk has slumped amid. China's economic slowdown. \"When we see any kind of changes to. Chinese buying patterns, it impacts on. New. Zealand farmers more dramatically,\" said. Emma. Higgins, senior agriculture analyst at. Rabobank in. New. Zealand. Northwest of. Auckland,. New. Zealand's biggest city,. David and. Janine. Kidd owe roughly 1.6 million to the bank and an additional 300,000 to a family loan tied to their dairy farm and equipment. Janine. Kidd went back to work full-time as an occupational therapist earlier this year so they could earn more cash to offset losses from the farmwhich. David. Kidd said could hit around 20,000 this season. Repairs to pathways where the cows walk are nearly double what he expected,. David. Kidd said, but they need to be fixed. If dairy prices don't improve next year, they may have to consider selling the farm. \"It's been a dream and a goal to get there to farm ownership. It would be a crushing blow to see it all disappear,\" he said. Even so, \"there have been days where. I question why on earth. I bought it.\". The. Woodward family owes about 2 million tied to their farm and equipment. There are signs. China's economy could be improving. Third-quarter economic growth recently came in at 4.9 compared with the previous year, faster than some economists had expected.

         "State supreme court says law is valid even though the Georgia legislature enacted it when Roe v. Wade protected abortion rights",
         "us-news",
         "U.S. Georgia's. Six-Week. Abortion. Ban. Upheld. State supreme court says law is valid even though the. Georgia legislature enacted it when. Roe v. Wade protected abortion rights 3 min. The ruling by. Georgia's. Supreme. Court was the latest in a flurry of legal battles over abortion. Georgia's highest court on. Tuesday upheld a law banning abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, a decision that will keep abortion access significantly constrained throughout most of the. South. A 6-to-1 majority of the. Georgia. Supreme. Court rejected a claim that the law, enacted in , was clearly unlawful when it was passed because. Roe v. Wade, which protected the right to an abortion, was the law of the land at the time. In. June of last year, the. U.S. Supreme. Court overruled. Roe and eliminated that right in. Dobbs v. Jackson. Women's. Health. Organization. Georgia's law took effect a short time later. The state court said. Tuesday that it must current legal precedent, meaning the six-week ban was constitutional under. Dobbs. The decision reversed a state trial judge who found that state law invalid on the grounds that it was unconstitutional four years ago. Justice. Verda. Colvin, writing for the court, noted that the. Dobbs decision found. Roe \"egregiously wrong from the start.\". The court had already issued an interim order that allowed the ban to be enforced during the litigation. The. Georgia ruling was the latest in a flurry of legal battles that have shifted to state courts in the year since. Roe was overturned. Without federal constitutional protections for the procedure, abortion-rights groups have mounted new legal arguments based on state constitutions, especially in states where the legislature and governor's office are controlled by. Republicans. The results so far have been mixed. Abortion-rights supporters won an initial victory in. South. Carolina earlier this year, but the court quickly reversed itself and allowed a six-week ban to go into effect. They also have scored some narrow victories in states such as. Oklahoma, where the state supreme court found a right for women to obtain abortions in medical emergencies. A number of cases, including in. Florida, remain unsettled. Georgia has seen a roughly 40 decline in abortions under the six-week ban, according to. WeCount, an abortion-data project sponsored of. Family. Planning, which supports abortion rights. Tuesday's ruling didn't resolve all the issues in the litigation. The state high court sent the case back to the trial level for consideration of other legal arguments, including whether the six-week ban violates a privacy provision in the state's constitution 's ability to make medical decisions. Republican. Gov. Brian. Kemp, who won re-election last. November, has said little publicly about abortion since signing the law four years ago. His office didn't respond to a request for comment. The state's. Republican attorney general,. Chris. Carr, said he was \"pleased with the court's decision\" and that his office would continue to defend the law. The six-week ban is likely to remain a contentious topic in the politically mixed state, where. Democrats have sought to paint. Republicans as extreme on the issue. President. Biden's re-election campaign in a statement. Tuesday said, \"This election could determine whether every woman in. America faces the same terrifying reality. Georgians will now face.\".

         "Former president and his fixer-turned-foe come face-to-face in courtroom five years after bitter split 6 min. A courtroom sketch shows. Donald. Trump looking on as his former fixer and lawyer,. Michael. Cohen, testified in the. New. York attorney general's civil fraud case against the ex-president. Michael. Cohen,. Donald. Trump's scorned ex-confidant, testified against his former boss during an electric day in court, telling a. New. York judge that. Trump commanded him to \"reverse engineer\" estimates of the former president's financial wealth. The appearance. Tuesday by. Cohen, which came in the. New. York attorney general's civil-fraud case against the former president and his business, placed the two men face-to-face five years after their bitter split. When. Cohen took the stand midday and swore to tell the truth,. Trump sat a few feet away at the defense tablecross-armed and stone-faced. \"I was tasked by. Mr. Trump to increase the total assets based upon a number that he arbitrarily elected,\" said. Cohen, 57 years old, who once worked at the. Trump. Organization and served as. Trump's personal lawyer. Trump, who has attended parts of the trial, made the trip to. Manhattan to watch. Cohen in person. In a courthouse hallway,. Trump called. Cohen a \"proven liar\" and a felon. \"He served a lot of time for lying,\". Trump said. Cohen spent more than a year behind bars after pleading guilty to tax and campaign-finance crimes and lying to. Congress about. Trump's plans for a. Trump. Tower in. Moscow, among other federal charges. Over an afternoon of testimony,. Cohen said. Trump's wealth wasn't calculated but dictated by a boss determined to puff up his net worth. Cohen said he was part of a high-level team instructed to do what it had to do to make the asset valuations match. Trump's vision of himself as a titan of business. He said he and the. Trump. Organization's then-chief financial officer,. Allen. Weisselberg, had the responsibility to \"reverse engineer the various different asset classesto achieve the number that. Mr. Trump had tasked us.\" \"You have lied numerous times under oath, isn't that correct?\" asked. Habba. \"That's correct,\". Cohen replied. Trump's lawyers say his financial statements were materially accurate and that he included disclaimers in them cautioning banks not to necessarily rely on his valuation methods and estimates. They also say that lenders profited from his business and that. Trump never defaulted on the loans in question. In a courtroom hallway, former. President. Donald. Trump called. Michael. Cohen a 'proven liar.'. Over his decade in the. Trump. Organization,. Cohen carved out a niche as the guardian of. Trump's image, issuing legal threats to reporters and others in possession of information that could conceivably damage his boss, including a. Roman. Catholic priest. The two men were close through. Trump's presidential campaign, with. Cohen helping orchestrate hush-money payments to. Stormy. Daniels, a porn star, and. Karen. McDougal, a former. Playboy centerfold. Both women alleged sexual relationships with. Trump, who denied them. After. Trump became president,. Cohen found himself frozen out of the. White. House, ensnared in a sex scandal coverup and in legal peril. Though. Cohen advertised himself as the new president's personal lawyer,. Trump had little to do with him. But. Cohen traded on his history with. Trump to land consulting contracts with companies desperate for an inside track with the new administration. He drew the attention of federal investigators, who began looking into his finances and the hush-money payments. Prosecutors charged him in with campaign-finance violations, tax evasion and lying to. Congress about the extent of efforts to build a. Trump. Tower in. Moscow during the campaign. As his legal fees mounted, the. Trump. Organization resisted paying, and inquiries on. Cohen's behalf about a presidential pardon met with lukewarm responses. Cohen broke with. Trump in explosive fashion, accusing the man he had once revered of directing the hush-money payments as he pleaded guilty before a federal judge. He then testified to. Trump's alleged misdeeds in congressional hearing after hearing. Former president. Donald. Trump is facing four separate indictments at both state and federal levels. WSJ breaks down each of the indictments and what they mean for his presidential campaign. Photo. Illustration. Annie. Zhao. It was. Cohen's congressional testimony about. Trump's dealings with lenders that sparked the. New. York civil case, brought. Attorney. General. Letitia. James, which now threatens the. Republican presidential front-runner's business empire. James's office has pointed to. Cohen's sworn accounts as evidence that. Trump over many years supplied bogus information to lenders and other financial institutions to secure hundreds of millions of dollars in loans. She is seeking 250 million in penalties and has already persuaded the presiding judge,. New. York. Supreme. Court. Justice. Arthur. Engoron, to cancel state business certificates held by. Trump.

         "Blinken promises a swift and decisive response, but will Biden back it up?",
         "opinion",
         "REVIEW. OUTLOOK. Oct. 24, 621 pm. ET 3 min. Secretary of. State. Antony. Blinken speaks during a. United. Nations. Security. Council meeting called to address the ongoing. Israel-Palestianian conflict, in. New. York on. Wednesday. Secretary of. State. Antony. Blinken warned. Tuesday that the. U.S. would respond \"swiftly and decisively\" to any attack on. American forces from. Iran or its proxies. That's a welcome message aimed at deterring the mullahs in. Tehran and their agents. But will the. President enforce the red line he appears to be drawing? He hasn't so far. 2109 1x \"The. United. States does not seek conflict with. Iran,\". Mr. Blinken said at the. United. Nations. \"We do not want this war to widen. But if. Iran or its proxies attack. U.S. personnel anywhere, make no mistake. We will defend our people.\". Mr. Blinken's remarks are the sharpest. U.S. warning to. Iran so far, and from the most senior. U.S. official. They go beyond. President. Biden's previous vague warnings of \"don't\" to discourage. Hezbollah or. Iran from getting involved in the. Hamas-Israel war. Clearly the. White. House is worried, and it should be. Even the. Administration has been obliged to acknowledge that. Iranian clients have used drones and rockets to attack. U.S. forces in the. Middle. East more than a dozen times in the past week. White. House spokesman. John. Kir that. Iran is \"in some cases, actively facilitating these attacks\" on. U.S. positions in. Iraq and that \"Iran's goal is to maintain some level of deniability here, but we're not going to allow them to do that.\". A senior defense official noted this week that \"when you see this uptick in activity and attacks\" in the. Middle. East, \"there's. Iranian fingerprints all over it.\". The obvious implication of. Mr. Blinken's remarks is that if. American forces are attacked, the. U.S. will respond with military force. Multiple reports suggest that. Iran's clients are planning more attacks on. U.S. positions in the. Middle. East. The. Pentagon has dispatched more air defenses and on. Tuesday announced an. F-16 deployment to complement other fighter aircraft in the region. One carrier strike group is already operating in the area and another is on the way. So when will the swift and decisive. U.S. response arrive? Mr. Biden no doubt remembers. Barack. Obama's \"red line\" warning to. Syria in over the use of chemical weapons that went unenforced when. Bashar al-Assad crossed it. The fallout from that failure of deterrence and -through included. Vladimir. Putin's intervention to the. Assad regime, then his invasions of. Crimea and eastern. Ukraine. The. Biden. Administration wants to deter a second front against. Israel from. Iran's proxies in. Lebanon and. Syria. But failing to respond to. Iran's many attacks, even when there are so far no. U.S. troop casualties, is an invitation to. Iran to keep calling the. U.S. bluff. This could invite the provocation the. White. House is trying so hard to avoid. One risk is that. Iran or its proxies will eventually kill. Americans in these attacks, which might require an even greater use of. U.S. force and would be damaging politically. Or the. U.S. might have to intervene to help. Israel defeat. Hezbollah. Iran is using its proxies to test. U.S. resolve. The more they attack without. Iran paying a price, the more likely that. Iran will raise the stakes. The paradox. Mr. Biden has to appreciate. The most stabilizing move for the region would be restoring. America as a deterrent power. Journal. Editorial. Report. Paul. Gigot interviews. Middle. East specialist. Clifford. May. Images.

         "REVIEW. OUTLOOK. Trump's stolen election claims keep hurting everyone but himself. Oct. 24, 616 pm. ET 3 min. Jenna. Ellis reads a statement after pleading guilty to a felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings, inside. Fulton. Superior. Court. Judge. Scott. McAfee's. Fulton. County. Courtroom at the. Fulton. County. Courthouse on. Tuesday. Donald. Trump is still pretending that the presidential election \"was. RIGGED. STOLLEN,\" as he put it the other day on. Truth. Social, where he also teased an imminent unveiling of \"massive information and 100 evidence.\". Meantime, in the real world, three lawyers who assisted with. Mr. Trump's schemes to reverse his defeat have pleaded guilty to crimes in. Georgia. 2109 1x. The latest is. Jenna. Ellis, who on. Tuesday tearfully read a statement to the court, acknowledging she had pushed specious claims, including to state lawmakers, without due diligence. \"What. I did not do but should have done, your honor, was to make sure that the facts the other lawyers alleged to be true were in fact true,\" she said. \"If. I knew then what. I know now,. I would have declined to represent. Donald. Trump in these postelection challenges.\". Ms. Ellis pleaded guilty to the felony of aiding and abetting false statements and writings. She will get five years of probation, plus restitution and community service. Kenneth. Chesebro received a similar sentence for one count of conspiracy to file false documents. Sidney. Powell will avoid jail as well, after pleading guilty to misdemeanors. They agreed to cooperate in the broader case brought. District. Attorney. Fani. Willis, which could mean testifying against. Mr. Trump. The press is playing up the legal significance of the plea deals, as if. Ms. Ellis can now release the. Kraken on. Mr. Trump, to steal. Ms. Powell's indelible catchphrase. But it's difficult to know how much dirt these attorneys really have on the former. President, and some of his potential defenses are legal, not factual. Ms. Willis's indictment leans on. Georgia's expansive. Racketeer. Influenced and. Corrupt. Organizations. Act, or. RICO, treating. Mr. Trump's election maneuvers like a mafia operation. Yet. Ms. Willis has let these lawyers cop to minor charges without racketeering, which the legal commentator. Andrew. McCarthy sees as evidence of an underlying weakness in her in surrounded himself with kooky advisers, but do they qualify as an \"enterprise\" under the. RICO statute? Such questions aren't idle, and to ask them isn't to dismiss all of. Ms. Willis's case. The most straightforward sections of her indictment were the allegations that. Ms. Powell, while hunting for phantom fraud, hired a contractor to tamper with election equipment in. Coffee. County. Ensuring the physical security of voting machines is a legitimate state interest, and it's toxic to voter confidence for one side to be fiddling with the equipment. But. Mr. Trump wasn't covered . Ms. Willis's legal theories remain untested, and if she overcharged her case, it could redound to. Mr. Trump's political benefit, which is what he most cares about. The plea deals loyalists underscore how. Mr. Trump's tantrum after the election harmed everyone who has been associated with it. That includes the country in more poisonous politics, the. Republican. Party in lost elections, media hosts in lost reputations, and the many former advisers who find themselves in the legal dock. The tragedy of. Ms. Ellis is that she followed. Mr. Trump's pied-piper claims and now finds her career ruined, while the man she believed in uses what she now admits are falsehoods to march again to the. White. House. Wonder. Land. As the.

A trial date hasn't been scheduled, but a flurry of commitments to cooperate obtained. District. Attorney. Fani. Willis shows she is homing in on those who gave.

Powell at a freewheeling press briefing on. Nov. 19, , describing the lawyers as an \"elite strike force team\" investigating voter fraud. A spokesman for. Willis declined to comment. Ellis was the first defendant to publicly read an apology letter in open court. Tearing up, she said she should have done more to investigate the voter-fraud claims she made in late when she was crisscrossing the country with. Giuliani. \"I failed to do my due diligence,\" she said. \"If. I knew then what. I know now,. I would have declined to represent. Donald. Trump in these postelection challenges. I look back on this whole experience with deep remorse.\". Jenna. Ellis said she neglected to do her due diligence. Fulton. County. Superior. Court. Judge. Scott. McAfee on. Tuesday signed off on a sentence for. Ellis negotiated by. Willis's office five years of probation along with 5,000 in restitution and 100 hours of community service. As part of her deal with prosecutors, she pleaded guilty to one count of aiding and abetting the filing of false statementsnamely, testimony a. Georgia. Senate subcommittee in. December that tens of thousands of mail-in ballots had been fabricated and voting machines had flipped votes. That implicates. Giuliani in a criminal act, legal experts said. He faces charges for allegedly attempting to persuade. Georgia senators to violate their oaths of office electors, knowingly making false claims of election fraud and forging documents to pave the way for the scheme. \"This is some pretty methodical plea bargaining attorney's office,\" said. Amy. Lee. Copeland, a defense lawyer in. Georgia and a former federal prosecutor. \"If you plead guilty it has a snowball effectit encourages more people to come forward,\" she added. Photo. Illustration. Annie. Zhao. Trump's lawyer. Steve. Sadow noted that none of the four defendants to have taken deals has pleaded guilty to the racketeering charge at the heart of the case. The former president pleaded not guilty. \"What that shows is this so-called. RICO case is nothing more than a bargaining chip for. Willis,\". Sadow said, using common legal phrase for racketeering cases. Even though defendants haven't admitted to racketeering, they are boosting. Willis's case the acts that allegedly furthered the conspiracy, said. E. Jay. Abt, a criminal defense attorney in. Atlanta. He praised her strategy as simple \"To plead out all the little fish to testify against the big fish.\". Abt expected the focus will shift to. Trump and his close advisers. Giuliani, former. Trump. White. House chief of staff. Mark. Meadows, and. John. Eastman, another. Trump lawyer. A representative for. Meadows, who had pleaded not guilty in the case, didn't immediately respond to request for comment. Eastman, a constitutional lawyer and an architect of. Trump's postelection litigation, has said he won't take a plea deal. In late ,. Eastman worked with. Chesebro on a plan to prepare slates of electors pledged to. Trump in states he had lost. \"There is absolutely a first-mover advantage,\" said. Marc. Hershovitz, a. Georgia lawyer who has followed the case. \"If you plead early, it's more likely you are able to give prosecutors valuable information.\". One of. Eastman's lawyers,. Harvey. Silverglate, said his client was being prosecuted for the routine act of giving legal advice. That is the defense. Eastman will make at trial, and plea deals by co-defendants won't change that, he said. Willis's case largely turns on one question. When does legal advice cross the line into crime? \"I assumed some of these people would flip because the government put extortive pressure on these defendants,\". Silverglate said, noting that. RICO charges carry a 20-year maximum sentence. In. August,. Ellis had criticized. Trump for not paying the legal bills of his co-defendants in the. Georgia case. She was able to raise more than 200,000 in crowdfunded donations, but defending a. RICO case at trial costs much more than that, legal experts said. Ellis,. Powell and. Chesebro are unlikely to lose their law licenses. Willis's office has stipulated that none of them have pleaded guilty to a \"a crime of moral turpitude\" the sort of offense that leads to disbarment in most. U.S. jurisdictions. Fulton. County. District. Attorney. Fani. Willis is climbing the ladder to get to. Trump's inner circle to bolster her case, legal observers say. Because the three lawyers are all first-time criminal offenders, under. Georgia law their charges will be removed from their permanent records if they comply with the terms of their probation. In her apology,. Ellis signaled she would testify against those higher than her in the chain command. \"I relied on others, including lawyers with many more years of experience than. I, to provide me with true and reliable information,\" she said. \"What. I did not dobut should have done,. Your. Honorwas to make sure that the facts the other lawyers alleged to be true were in fact true.\". Jenna. Ellis appeared alongside. Rudy. Giuliani and. Sidney. Powell at a press briefing on. Nov. 19, .

         "390 5 min. SAG-Aftra. President. Fran. Drescher speaks at a rally in support of the actors union's strike in. New. York,. Aug. 1. Among the big names on a. Zoom call last week of. Hollywood actors questioning their union over lack of progress in the actor's strike was. Meryl. Streep. Her name jumps out because 112 days earlier she signed a letter with other major stars urging a strike at a moment when a planarian might have noticed the union's leverage was at low ebb thanks to the collapse of cable subscribership, streaming losses and the decline of movie-going. Nanny. Defarge, aka. Fran. Drescher, the union boss, saw the light, however, and began out-mau-mauing the letter signers. Until that moment, she had insisted talks with the studios were making \"exceptional progress.\". Even the. New. York. Times now says her sudden adoption of blood-curdling rhetoric has been an obstacle to a deal. Talks with the studios were scheduled to resume. Tuesday after a collapse that only illustrates the failure of the union to conjure a coherent strategy. Members lament, in the streaming age, loss of the opportunity to score big if a. TV show becomes a hit and lives on in syndication. Few shows became a \"MASH\" or \"Seinfeld,\" but the lucky participants were set for life. The union wants this practice resuscitated somehow in the streaming era but companies like. Netflix jealously guard their viewership data showing which movies and series are a hit. In what might seem a tolerable arrangement as a result, the streamers themselves bear most of the viewership risk at a time of pretty formulaic shows, when actors and writers at least get a predictable wage for showing up. In any case, the talks fell apart, a confused union had almost turned its ask on its head. Now it wanted a flat 57-cent per subscriber of the streaming company revenue, to be distributed according to the relative performance of shows, even if all are meh. This, at a time when streamers increasingly are looking to sports, news, documentaries and videogaming to attract subscribers. A fixed entitlement for members of the actor's guild when the streaming profit model remains in such flux made no sense and the studios said so. The union's latest fallback is unknown, but the actors have clearly lost the plot if they ever had it, just tossing random thoughts into a negotiation. Meanwhile, those on the. Zoom call, including. Ms. Streep,. George. Clooney and. Scarlett. Johansson, reportedly were focused primarily on the accumulating damage, offering on behalf of the highest-paid actors to pay 150 million in extra union dues to end the walkout. Actor and showbiz polymath. Tyler. Perry has a large studio operation in. Atlanta employing hundreds. Numerous movies have had to suspend production, including the. Clint. Eastwood-directed \"Juror. No. 2.\". Mr. Eastwood isn't getting any younger. Consider a very different approach. The. United. Auto. Workers, you can bet, started planning and strategizing its current strike before the ink was dry on its last contract four years ago. It chose its moment as vast dollops of taxpayer money were up for grabs from the. Biden administration electric-vehicle is running for re-election; the race looks close; his likely opponent,. Donald. Trump, has working-class appeal;. Mr. Biden peddles himself as the most labor-friendly president ever. The. UAW saw a now-or-never opportunity to make sure future auto assembly doesn't shift out of union-organized,. Big. Three-owned engine and transmission plants into nonunion battery plants controlled of. Tesla and. Chinese and. South. Korean companies. To distill one moral,. Hollywood is a place of magic and also, apparently, of magical thinking. Like the. French army expecting lan vital to carry the day in the place of sound strategy, the actors filled their heads with talk of fighting a war against \"corporate greed\" and the \"rise of the machines\" aka artificial intelligence when cold-eyed assessment of leverage and opportunity would have served them better. A crummy global moment invites us all to put our big-boy pants back on, looking upon the world with a modicum of dispassionate cool. SAG-Aftra should try it too. , the. Hollywood-related workforce has already lost 5 billion in income and 45,000 jobs and an end isn't in sight. In her latest utterance,. Ms. Drescher fake-roars that her members are waging a \"righteous. David vs. Goliath fight.\". In my 30 years in the opinion industry, funny how everybody makes this claim and yet nobody claims to be. Goliath. The triteness of her rhetoric only accentuates how completely her union entered upon a destructive strike without a plan and without a clue. With streaming disrupting the economics of the. TV and film industries, it doesn't help to alienate your audience with political posturing like. Disney has with its refashioning of classic fairy tales including the upcoming 'Snow. White.'. Images.

         "politics",
         "4 min. Donald. Trump, who is accused of conspiring to overturn his election loss, faces four criminal cases. WASHINGTONDonald. Trump's lawyers stepped up their challenges to federal charges that the former president conspired to overturn his election loss, arguing in court filings that the indictment violates his free-speech rights and targets him because he is. President. Biden's chief rival for the. White. House in . The long-shot legal motions represent. Trump's latest effort to have dismissed his federal election-interference prosecution and add to a mounting pile of requests under consideration by. U.S. District. Judge. Tanya. Chutkan, who has indicated she has a low tolerance for politics in her courtroom. Chutkan hasn't yet ruled on. Trump's earlier argument that the case should be tossed because he has immunity from prosecution for actions he took in his role as president. Special counsel. Jack. Smith's team has urged her to reject that claim and is expected to similarly oppose the latest challenges to the indictment, which accuses the former president of conspiring to cling to power through actions that culminated in the. Jan. 6, , attack on the. U.S. Capitol. WSJ breaks down four separate indictments that former. President. Donald. Trump is facingand what they mean for his campaign. Photo. Illustration. Annie. Zhao. Legal experts say the challenges probably won't derail the criminal trial in. Washington but could delay it legal issues that might take time to sort out. up now,. Trump's lawyers preserve the opportunity to make the same arguments on appeal should he be convicted. The trial is currently set to open in. March . It is one of four criminal cases facing the. Republican front-runner. In a flurry of late-night filings late. Monday,. Trump's lawyers argue that prosecutors have criminalized political speech and advocacy, and that the. First. Amendment gives their client the right to claim the election was marred by fraud, even though no allegations of widespread fraud were substantiated , federal investigators or the courts. \"The fact that the indictment alleges that the speech at issue was supposedly, according to the prosecution, 'false' makes no difference,\". Trump's team wrote. \"Under the. First. Amendment, each individual. American participating in a free marketplace of ideasnot the federal. Governmentdecides for him or herself what is true and false on great disputed social and political questions.\". In the indictment, prosecutors acknowledged that. Trump had a right to challenge the election results and even falsely claim fraud. But they said what he did went far beyond such rights and involved discounting legitimate votes. Trump's lawyers said prosecutors can't criminalize \"disputed\" claims about the outcome of the election \"simply because the. Government determines that some views are 'true' and others are 'false.'\" \"The. First. Amendment embraces and encourages exactly this kind of behavior,\" they wrote. The defense team also says the. Justice. Department is vindictively prosecuting. Trump for political reasons, arguing that. Smith's appointment days after. Trump announced his candidacy was \"part of a flawed effort to insulate. Biden and his supporters from scrutiny of their obvious and illegal bias.\" \"Biden's publicly stated objective is to use the criminal justice system to incapacitate. President. Trump, his main political rival and the leading candidate in the coming election,\" the lawyers wrote. Courts have set a very high bar for defendants to argue they were selectively prosecuted, requiring them to show that others similarly situated aren't being prosecuted and that any discrimination is intentional. Short of having the case dismissed outright,. Trump's lawyers also asked. Chutkan to strike from the indictment references to the. Jan. 6 attack on the. Capitol by a mob of his supporters. Trump isn't charged with inciting the riot, but prosecutors say his election-result denials stoked tensions that led to it. \"Because the. Government has not charged. President. Trump with responsibility for the actions at the. Capitol on. January 6, , allegations related to these actions are not relevant and are prejudicial and inflammatory,\" the defense said. Bags of.

         "New abortion bans have done little to reduce frequency of the procedure, new data show",
         "us-news",
         "U.S. Oct. 24, 1000 am. ET 7 min. Change from. April to. June. Six-week ban in effect 0 20 40. More than a year after the. Supreme. Court overturned. Roe v. Wade, one thing seems clear. New state bans have done little so far to deter women from obtaining abortions. Data released. Tuesday shows the number of abortions ticked up slightly in the year following the high court's. Dobbs v. Jackson. Women's. Health. Organization decision. That ruling, from. June , ended federal protections for the procedure, and paved the way for some 16 states to ban many or most abortions. The data indicate that abortion providers, funders and others have adapted quickly to a legal landscape that has changed profoundly. Access has been cut off throughout much of the. South, and demand has surged in states in which abortion is still legal. Many providers there have had to significantly increase capacity. The findings also underscore the challenges facing antiabortion groups, as the ease of traveling to another state or obtaining abortion pills online seem to be largely undercutting laws intended to reduce abortions. 15 7.8 10 5 0 -5 -10 -15. Jan. In the new study,. WeCount, an abortion-data project sponsored of. Family. Planning, which supports abortion rights, found that nationwide there were 183 more monthly abortions on average in the 12-month period following the. Dobbs decision compared with the monthly average prior to the decision. That trend mirrors similar findings. Institute, a research group that also supports abortion rights, which showed the number of abortions rising in most states in the first half of this year compared with , the most recent year for which data are available. \"I have been surprised to see the evidence that is mounting that abortions have had a slight increase,\" said. Caitlin. Myers, an economics professor at. Middlebury. College who has studied abortion data. While it has become much harder since the end of. Roe to obtain an abortion in states with newly enacted bans, it actually appears to have become easier in many other states, thanks to increased attention and resources. Abortion funds, nonprofits that help finance abortions and logistics associated with them, have raised millions to help lower-income women pay for procedures and travel, while new clinics have opened in states such as. Illinois and. New. Mexico that have become major destinations for women traveling from other states. Nearly 115,000 fewer abortions were performed in the year after the. Dobbs decision in states that banned abortions throughout pregnancy or after six weeks, according to the. WeCount data. At the same time, states including. Illinois,. Florida and. North. Carolinawhere the procedure remained largely legalsaw an increase of 117,000 abortions. The data don't include women who order pills online from overseas outside of the formal medical system, a practice that appears to have become more common. Funds and nonprofits that help finance abortions have raised millions of dollars to help women pay for procedures and travel. Efforts focused on helping women travel seem to have also made it easier for some in-state residents to obtain abortions. For example, providing more telehealth appointments to accommodate increased demand can also make appointments more accessible for women in rural areas. In. California,. Planned. Parenthood of. Orange. San. Bernardino. Counties doubled the number of open appointments available for medication abortion at its nine locations in spring in anticipation of the high court's decision, said. Krista. Hollinger, the. Planned. Parenthood branch's chief operating officer. Those centers have seen an increase in out-of-state patients, but more. Californians are getting abortions as well. Planned. Parenthood of. Orange. San. Bernardino. Counties saw a 20 increase in its total abortion patient volume since. June , while only about a fifth of that increase came from out-of-state patients. Abortion providers say that while the number of abortions may not have significantly declined, laws have nonetheless created obstacles. For instance, women forced to travel out-of-state for an abortion may have to take time off work and involve friends and family members in a private medical decision because they need help traveling or with child care. Bans are also pushing some abortions further back into pregnancy, when they become more complicated and expensive. U.S. A. State-by-State. Guide to. Abortion. Access. For antiabortion advocates, the policy options available to combat the ease of traveling and obtaining pills online present major challenges. Any efforts to prevent women from traveling out of state for abortions could run up against constitutional challenges. Restricting the use of abortion pills ordered online from overseas or out-of-state actors is difficult without punishing the women who take themlong something antiabortion groups have pledged to avoid. Abortion opponents are fighting hard to garner support from. Republican presidential candidates for a national abortion limit, but such a proposal has little hope of making it through the current. Congress. \"We're now forced to think about this as a national problem,\" said. Katie. Daniel, state policy director for. Susan. B. Anthony. Pro-Life. America, an antiabortion group. Daniel said the antiabortion movement could end up back in federal court challenging shield laws enacted in a number of blue states designed to provide legal protection for doctors who prescribe pills to women in states with bans. While few states appear likely to pass new abortion bans in the coming months, the landscape of abortion access remains unsettled. In. Florida, which has seen one of the largest upticks in abortions since the. Dobbs decision, the state's highest court is expected to release a decision soon that could allow a six-week ban to go into effect. Access to abortion pills is being tested in court. In the first month since. North. Carolina passed a 12-week limit, the number of abortions in the state declined -third from the prior month, according to. Guttmacher. The law increased requirements for in-person medical visits, which providers say has virtually eliminated visits from out-of-state patients. A challenge to approval for a widely used abortion pill appears headed to the. U.S. Supreme. Court and could potentially upend access across the country in the next year if it succeeds. Abortion-rights groups also acknowledge that they face internal risks, including staff burnout at clinics that remain open and a decrease in fundraising firepower if public attention fades. The. Chicago. Abortion. Fund has quadrupled its staff and tripled its budget since . The fund has provided about 4.5 million to thousands of patients to assist with plane, train and bus tickets; hotel stays; child care; and other costs since. Roe was struck down. \"This is not a long-term solution,\" said. Megan. Jefyio, executive director of the. Chicago. Abortion. Fund. \"We are dealing with competing crises in this country and. I don't know how long we're going to have this sustained support.\". From a high-stakes legal battle over the abortion pill mifepristone, to states debating their own legislation,. WSJ's. Laura.

         "Oct. 25, 900 pm. ET 5 minutes. When. Elon. Musk acquired. Twitter a year ago, he pledged to turn the social-media platform into an \"everything app\" that would eclipse what the long-struggling business had accomplished since its founding in . One year in, much of. Musk's grand vision has yet to play out. The company is struggling on a number of metrics, according to third-party data, including attracting users. It is trying to rebuild its advertising business after that revenue plummeted post takeover, and the platform also has been navigating content-moderation challenges after. Musk loosened such rules. Musk has said. X is thriving, posting in. August that the platform hit records for \"user-seconds\" in recent months. The company said in. September it has 245 million daily active users, lower than the 259.4 million figure. Musk shared in.

         "Airline. Industry's 'Silent'. Struggle. Pilots and. Mental. Health. Pilots fear career repercussions for seeking mental health help; authorities say. Alaska. Airlines pilot accused of attempting to disable jet's engines spoke of depression, losing friend 8 min. Your browser does not support. HTML5 video. \"I'm not. OK.\". Those words from an off-duty. Alaska. Airlines pilot, authorities said, preceded an episode last weekend in which he briefly attempted to disable a commercial jet's engines midflight. They have also thrust back to the fore a long-running debate over how to assess and treat airline pilots' mental health. Often portrayed as steely nerved and confident, pilots sometimes have been reluctant to and seek treatment for mental health struggles, for fear they could lose their jobs or derail their careers, regulators and advocacy groups say. The role that the. Alaska. Airlines pilot's mental state may have played in the incident isn't clear. Authorities said that he spoke afterward about struggles with depression, and the recent death of a friend. The. Federal. Aviation. Administration relies on pilots to self-disclose mental health conditions. But pilots in some cases don't report these conditions because of potential career repercussions and fear of financial hardship, according to a. July report. Department's inspector general's office. Pilots aren't automatically disqualified from flying if they are diagnosed with anxiety, depression or other mental health conditions, but the. FAA monitors them closely. There is a stigma against talking about mental health struggles in the aviation industry, said. Nastassja. Lewis, a flight attendant and founder of the thAIRapy organization, which advocates for better mental-health care in aviation. \"It's like a silent cancer in this industry,\". Lewis said. Pilots in particular can be reluctant to admit mental health struggles because they fear being pulled off the job for further evaluation, which means added stress from not being able to support their families or pay their mortgages,. Lewis said. Pilots are subject to medical certificates that determine their fitness to fly. A study published last year in the. Journal of. Occupational and. Environmental. Medicine found that about 56 of 3,765 pilots surveyed reported behaviors such as avoiding seeking medical care, going outside formal channels, or not disclosing health information due to the perceived risk of losing their flying status. In many cases, pilots' fears about being permanently sidelined may be unwarranted, but can lead them to hold off on seeking help until symptoms worsen, the study said. \"Really what we should be doing is encouraging them to seek care early,\" said. Dr. William. Hoffman, one of the study's authors and a neurologist and aeromedical researcher at the. University of. North. Dakota. The. FAA said pilots must report mental health conditions during regular medical exams, and it encourages pilots to seek treatment since most conditions, if treated, don't disqualify pilots from flying. Pilots who start taking certain antidepressants, for example, need to wait six months for any side effects to stabilize and undergo evaluation before they can be cleared to fly again. The agency said it has sought to eliminate stigma around mental health in aviation. The. FAA also said it would revoke a pilot's medical certificate if it becomes aware of significant mental health issues. Joseph. David. Emerson appeared in court. Tuesday on dozens of attempted murder charges after allegedly trying to disable an aircraft's engines midflight. Joseph. Emerson, the. Alaska. Airlines pilot arrested following the incident on the. Horizon. Air flight. Sunday, told police that he had struggled with depression for six months, according to federal charging documents. Documents filed separately said that. Emerson spoke of dealing with depression for six years, and that a friend had recently died. Emerson's lawyer described him as a dedicated family man who would never intentionally hurt other people. Authorities suggested. Emerson had taken psychedelic mushrooms at some point before the flight, though his lawyer said that he wasn't under the influence of any intoxicants. Emerson has worked as an airline pilot for over 20 years. Alaska said that throughout his career,. Emerson had completed his mandated medical certifications as required, and said his certification had never been denied, suspended or revoked. Alaska said. Emerson had shown no signs of impairment. Sunday that would have led gate agents or flight crew to stop him from getting on the plane. The chairman of the union that represents. Alaska pilots said in a message to members. Wednesday that the. Air. Line. Pilots. Association has resources and assistance available for pilots experiencing additional pressure and stress. \"These recent days have been unsettling and challenging for many of us,\" he wrote. The incident follows others in recent decades in which pilots are suspected of commandeering plane controls, in some cases ending their livesand those of passengers. About a dozen plane crashes in recent decades are believed to have been caused others at the controls, according to the. Aviation. Safety. Network, which tracks air incidents. In other cases, pilots have diverted flights to seek asylum. The crash of a. Germanwings flight into an alpine ridge occurred after a co-pilot locked the flight's captain out of the cockpit in what authorities said was an intentional act. A. German prosecutor said that the co-pilot previously had undergone therapy because of suicidal tendencies, before he obtained a commercial pilot license. In , a. China. Eastern jet plunged into a mountain at high speed after a near-vertical descent, killing 132 people. Data from one of the plane's black boxes suggested inputs to the controls pushed the plane into the dive,. The. Wall. Street. Journal reported. China. Eastern has said that the pilots' health, family conditions and financial status were sound, and that a possible cockpit intrusion wasn't plausible. Pilots aren't automatically disqualified from flying if they are diagnosed with anxiety, depression or other mental health conditions, but the. FAA monitors them closely. On. Sunday,. Emerson told one flight attendant he had recently lost his best friend and asked when the nightmare would end, according to state charging documents. He was restrained in a flight attendant's seat with flex cuffs, and police said that. Emerson told them that he hadn't slept in 40 hours and felt like he was having a nervous breakdown. Emerson denied taking any medication, authorities said, and a responding officer said that he didn't appear to be under the influence of intoxicants. Mental health poses a particular challenge in monitoring potential insider threats because of disincentives for pilots to self-report, said. Philip. Baum, managing director of. Green. Light, a. London-based aviation security consulting firm. Baum has called for an anonymous reporting system for colleagues or relatives to report signs of mental health crises. \"Even if you're doing a routine screening, it's quite easy for somebody that wants to hide it to be able to hide it during that one appointment,\". Baum said. \"Whereas people whose behavior deteriorates over a period of time might be identified and family, or . And everybody will be doing everybody else a favor if they reported those concerns.\". Andrew. Tangel contributed to this article. The. Transportation. Department's inspector general's office in. July issued a report that examined how the. Federal. Aviation. Administration handles pilots reporting mental health conditions.

House elected. GOP. Rep. Mike. Johnson of. Louisiana as speaker. Wednesday, with the staunch conservative overcoming the divisions that had paralyzed the chamber after a band of hard-liners ousted. Kevin. McCarthy three weeks ago. The choice of. Johnson, who led an effort to help former. President. Donald. Trump try to overturn the election results, came after. House.

Johnson said in a speech after he accepted the gavel from. Democratic leader. Hakeem. Jeffries of. New. York. He said. Republicans would \"fight vigorously\" with. Democrats but would also seek common ground. Johnson's victory brought to a close weeks of intraparty fighting that had prompted some members to wonder whether any colleague could thread the needle in the deeply divided conference, or whether some sort of deal with. Democrats would be needed. Known for his conservative stances on cultural issues and spending,. Johnson had breezed to victory in one roundunlike. McCarthy, who required 15 ballots in. January. His win brought a measure of calm and unity in the party not seen since. Republicans took over the. House in the elections. Rep. Blaine. Luetkemeyer. R.,. Mo. said.

Johnson. \"Mike has the least enemies in this conference,\" said. Rep. Ken. Buck. R.,. Colo. when asked how. Johnson managed to secure the speakership. In contrast with previous votes,. Wednesday's was drama free. Earlier speaker nominees had watched closely as members' names were called alphabetically and defections racked up, but. Republicans stuck together this time. In the tally on the. House floor,. Johnson received 220 votes to 209 for. Jeffries. \"The. Honorable. Mike. Johnsonis duly elected speaker of the. House of. Representatives for the 118th.

House official. Johnson, a constitutional lawyer, has a more stridently conservative record than. McCarthy. The new speaker served on. Trump's impeachment defense team and led an effort to collect signatures for an amicus brief in support of a. Texas lawsuit that sought unsuccessfully to overturn the presidential election results by voiding 20 million votes in four other states. When a reporter asked. Johnson late.

A religious man,. Johnson drew on. Scripture in his floor remarks, telling lawmakers that \"God is the one that raises up those in authorityhe raised up each of you.\". In a nod to his sudden rise from relative obscurity,. Johnson said in his speech that his wife. Kelly hadn't been able to make it to. Washington. \"We couldn't get a flight in time,\" he said. Johnson served in. House. Republican leadership as a deputy whip and vice chairman of the. House. Republican. Conference. But lawmakers said. Johnson benefited from not being considered part of the core leadership team, whose decisions about policy issues, including the debt limit and spending levels, have divided. House. Republicans. Those disagreements culminated in. McCarthy's removal and have hobbled efforts to find a replacement. Johnson previously led the. Republican. Study. Committee, a broad group of conservative members, and serves on the. House. Judiciary. Committee, but has less experience in leadership than the previous three speaker picks. Several picks for. GOP nominee for. House speaker, including. Rep. Tom. Emmer, have been blocked . As a lawyer, he defended. Louisiana's same-sex marriage ban to the. Louisiana. Supreme. Court. In. Congress, he has continued to oppose same-sex marriage. Johnson is strongly opposed to abortion access and has proposed legislation that would make it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion. Republicans who had engineered the ouster of. McCarthy over what they called broken promises on spending and other issues threw their support behind. Johnson and said his election vindicated their effort. Many colleagues had called the move led by. Rep. Matt. Gaetz. R.,. Fla. to vacate the chair damaging to the party and the. House. \"I believe history will assess these three weeks as the most productive weeks of the 118th. Congress,\". Gaetz said. \"Because now we have both a man and a plan.\" \"This is the best case scenario,\" said. Rep. Nancy. Mace. R.,. S.C, another member of the group, whom. McCarthy had termed the \"Crazy. Eights led by. Gaetz.\". Other. Republicans were more than ready to move on. Bacon. R.,. Neb. said he received death threats after voting repeatedly last week to block. Jordan's speakership bid. After. Johnson's election. Wednesday, he said the ordeal was worth it, to get past. Jordan to. Johnson. Bacon, who represents a swing district.

London hedge-fund manager accused of manipulating the foreign-exchange market was convicted. Wednesday of fraud in a trial that opened a window into a complex corner of the global currency-trading business. A federal jury in. Manhattan deliberated for less than a day before finding. Neil. Phillips guilty of commodities fraud. The jury acquitted. Phillips, the former chief investment officer of. Glen. Point. Capital, of a separate conspiracy charge. The trial focused on a 20 million foreign-exchange options trade that. Glen. Point entered in . Phillips had a bullish view on the. South. African rand, and the contract paid off because that currency strengthened against the. U.S. dollar. But prosecutors argued. Phillips rigged the outcome much of the dollar-rand currency pair in. December of that year that he deliberately moved the exchange rate past the level needed to profit on his options contract. \"A jury unanimously found that. Neil. Phillips intentionally manipulated the foreign exchange, or 'FX' marketthe world's largest decentralized financial marketin order to trigger a 20 million windfall for his hedge fund under a barrier option,\". Manhattan. U.S. Attorney. Damian. Williams said. \"The policing of the financial markets is critical to the health and sanctity of our economy.\". The judge set sentencing for. March 14. The case against. Phillips, 53 years old, was prosecutors' latest move to rein in practices in the unregulated foreign-exchange market, which trades 7.5 trillion around the clock. The. Justice. Department brought a series of criminal cases over the past decade that accused bank traders of coordinating their efforts to rig currency rates. The world's biggest banks paid over 10 billion in fines worldwide to resolve the probes. Phillips argued that his trading was a legitimate part of his overall strategy betting on the rand. He believed the currency would strengthen as a result of a leadership vote that determined the next president of. South. Africa. Phillips said he didn't manipulate the exchange rate but was trading to enhance the value of his wager on the rand. \"We are extremely disappointed and believe strongly that. Neil. Phillips is innocent of the one charge on which he was found guilty,\" said his attorney,. Sean. Hecker. \"We will continue to fight for the right result.\". Phillips, who launched. Glen. Point. Capital in. London in with backing from financier. George. Soros, grew up in. South. Africa and began his career trading at a series of banks, including. Morgan. Stanley. He was executive producer of a documentary about the thousands of. Nazi war criminals who were never prosecuted for their roles in the. Holocaust. Phillips was convicted of commodities fraud and faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. A judge will decide his sentence at a later phase. Glen. Point bought a foreign-exchange option from. Morgan. Stanley in. October , ahead of the election for leader of the. African. National. Congress. The contract, known as a barrier option, was written to pay off if the exchange rate touched 12.50 rand per dollar. Phillips believed the rate would approach that level if. Cyril. Ramaphosa, the candidate seen as more friendly to business, won the. ANC election, according to court records. Ramaphosa did win and later became president of. South. Africa. Prosecutors used some of. Phillips's words against him at the trial. While the rand gained after. Ramaphosa was elected to steer the. ANC, the exchange rate didn't immediately get to 12.50. \"Need to trade thru 50,\". Phillips wrote in one of the chats that prosecutors cited in the indictment. With just a few days until the option expired,. Phillips, sitting in. South. Africa, directed a bank in. Singapore to sell dollars for rand until the rate crossed that price, prosecutors said. It was easier to move the price at that time because it was the day after. Christmas and the. London and. U.S. markets were quiet, the government said. \"He cheated exchange rate to win that bet,\" prosecutor. Kiersten. Fletcher said during last week's opening statements, according to a trial transcript. In the same time frame that. Phillips sold 725 million to buy rand,. Morgan. Stanley bought nearly 600 million while selling rand, according to court filings. Phillips argued that both parties traded for legitimate, self-interested reasons as the price of the asset neared the 12.50 barrier. Bags of. Cash. From. Drug. Cartels. Flood. Teller. Windows at.

         "The latest news analysis. MARKETS. FINANCE 98 5 min. First. Solar shares have gained in value this yearunlike most other clean-energy stocks. Clean-energy stocks have fallen out of favor, with pressures created rates outweighing supportive government policies. The iShares. Global. Clean. Energy. ETF closed. Wednesday at the lowest level since. July . The exchange-traded fund invests in renewable-energy companies and utilities in line with a benchmark compiled by. SP. Dow. Jones. Indices, including. First. Solar. FSLR -2.21 . It has plunged 33 this year. Some stocks have fallen even harder. U.S.-listed. Enphase. Energy has shed 64 in , while competitor. SolarEdge. Technologies has sunk 71. Excluding stocks that have been ejected from the. SP 500,. SolarEdge ranks as the index's worst performer this year. Supply-chain problems and waning demand have added to the challenges created costs. The result a stock-market selloff despite commitments by the. U.S. and other large economies to foster sustainable power generation. \"The policy backdrop is very supportive. But there are headwinds. Clean tech is a very interest-rate-sensitive sector,\" said. Simon. Webber, a global equities portfolio manager at. Schroders. He said the industry's long-term prospects were still good. \"I think this is a low point in the cycle,\". Webber added. The. Biden administration's. Inflation. Reduction. Act of allocates close to 400 billion to clean-energy development through direct funding and tax credits. This program has attracted more than 120 billion in project proposals, according to. ING. Meanwhile, the. European. Union is also endeavoring to build up its ability to generate homegrown energy and reduce its dependence on natural-gas importsthe. EU learned a tough lesson from disrupted. Russian supplies following the. Ukraine invasion. The bloc's lawmakers passed a bill last month that boosted its renewable-energy target for . The clean-energy sector broadly falls into two categories companies that make or deploy capital-intensive infrastructure, such as wind turbines or solar panels, and those that are developing new technology. Both groups come under pressure from higher rates. What is your outlook for clean energy stocks? Join the conversation below. The. Federal. Reserve has lifted its key interest rate to a 22-year high. In turn, market-based interest rates such as government bond yieldswhich help set borrowing costs across the economyhave surged. The 10-year. Treasury yield hit 5. Monday. Renewables projects typically need a lot of upfront funding to buy equipment such as solar panels and wind turbines, which is then repaid over time . As much as 80 of such projects are financed by debt, according to a. U.S. government report. Pricier loans eat into projects' expected returns, making it less attractive to embark on new developments. Rising rates also hurt riskier investments such as nascent clean-energy technologies. Current interest rates are used investors in calculating what future cash flows should be worth today. For more speculative investments, whose value is based largely on far-off future cash flows, higher rates result in a lower valuation. While tech stocks have felt this pressure for a while, excitement over artificial intelligence has shielded some companies, said. Shaniel. Ramjee, a multiasset fund manager at. Pictet. Asset. Management. \"There isn't much overlap between. AI and clean tech, though,\" he added. Other problems are further spooking investors. Munich-based. Siemens. Energy scrapped its profit outlook in. June after its wind unit said turbine components were failing more often, while executives at. Danish wind-turbine manufacturer. Vestas. Wind. Systems have warned of persistent supply-chain disruptions that will last through the rest of this year. Some makers of home solar equipment are struggling with softening demand and say that installers have built up high backlogs of inventories, resulting in lower orders. Many buyers of solar panels for houses finance them using loans, making these purchasers also sensitive to higher interest rates. SolarEdge, which makes inverters for converting current generated , slashed its revenue forecasts last week. The move sparked a record 27 collapse in its shares and prompted a string of price-target cuts and ratings downgrades from analysts at banks such as. Goldman. Sachs and. Deutsche. Bank. Some fund managers expect the turbulence to be short-lived, and see this as a good time to buy. \"Nothing has changed in the long-term picture. So this might be an interesting opportunity, now that valuations have really come down,\" said. Caroline. Simmons, chief investment officer at. UBS. Global. Wealth. Management in the.

         "Merchants pushed for years to lower fees they pay banks when consumers shop with debit cards",
         "finance",
         "The latest news analysis. MARKETS. FINANCE. Fed. Floats. Deep. Cuts to. Debit-Card. Swipe. Fees , 47 5 min. At present, merchants pay large card issuers such as. JPMorgan. Chase and. Bank of. America 21 cents plus 0.05 of the transaction amount. WASHINGTONThe. Federal. Reserve proposed lowering by about 30 the fees merchants pay to many banks when consumers shop with debit cards, setting off a fight with banks that oppose the changes. 21 cents plus 0.05 of the transaction amount, which is the level set in . The. Fed can lower the cap if it determines the costs for processing debit-card payments are declining, but it had never previously done so. Wednesday's plan would reduce the fees to 14.4 cents plus 0.04 of the transaction amount. Going forward, the proposal also envisions adjusting the fees every other year, suggesting more reductions could be on the way. The. Fed said it would modestly increase a fraud-prevention fee. The. Wall. Street. Journal last week reported that the. Fed would propose reducing fees. Interchange fees are paid by merchantsfrom national retailers to local auto shopswhen consumers shop with their debit cards. The fees are pocketed other financial institutions that issue those cards. Merchants say swipe fees for credit and debit cards drive up costs for. U.S. shoppers. Merchants often tack on at least some of the cost of these fees into the sticker prices they charge consumers. Banks say there is no evidence that reduced fees will mean lower prices for consumers. The. Fed said. Wednesday that its data show costs to debit-card issuers have declined in recent years, which is why regulators want to lower the fees. For an average transaction of 50,. Wednesday's proposal would have the effect of lowering swipe fees by about 28,. Fed officials said. The. Fed now will collect public comment that would likely include heavy lobbying from card issuers and merchants and congressional attention. It would require a final vote bank's governors to be implemented. Fed governor. Michelle. Bowman dissented from. Wednesday's vote, saying she feared the cumulative effect of a raft of regulatory changesincluding the lower debit fees and higher capital requirements\"could pose ongoing risks to the health of certain financial institutions and the overall. U.S. banking system.\". A section of the. Dodd-Frank law called the. Durbin amendment gave the. Fed the power to set caps for banks and other financial institutions with 10 billion or more in assets. Merchants have been asking the. Fed to lower debit interchange fees for years, and the. Supreme. Court agreed to hear a case seeking to force the. Fed to do so. The case was brought by a. North. Dakota-based truck stop and convenience store that challenged the existing cap as too high. Banks subject to the cap received 16.6 billion of these fees in , according to trade publication. Nilson. Report. The banks say the fees help pay for keeping debit-card transactions safe from fraud. Previous. Fed research has shown costs for operating debit cards are going down, and the central bank said it would review the cap. Do you think the. Fed made the right decision around debit-card fees? Why or why not? Join the conversation below. Debit-card interchange-fee revenue collected other issuers plummeted after the fee cap kicked in, but has been rising in recent years as more people shift from shopping with cash to cards. Banks started pushing customers more toward credit cards, in large part travel rewards and other perks. Card networks set interchange fees for credit cards, and they are much higher and more lucrative for banks than the debit-card fees. The debit-fee cap also created a two-tiered system between issuers. Small banks and other card issuers that aren't subject to the fee cap reap debit-interchange fees that can run north of 1.5 of the transaction amount. Many fintech companies have been joining with small banks so that they can offer generous debit-card rewards programs to consumers. The. Fed said. Wednesday that its proposal to lower the debit swipe fees could have mixed results on consumers. It could allow merchants to pass on savings to shoppers, but it could also result in banks increasing fees tied to debit cards or deposit accounts, the regulator said. Bags of. Cash. From. Drug.

FRANCE-PRESSEGETTY. IMAGES ,. Siobhan. HughesFollow. RESPONSES 11 minutes. WASHINGTONIn choosing. Mike. Johnson as the new. House speaker,. Republicans have cast their lot with a little-known congressman from. Louisiana who has made his name pushing conservative positions on cultural issues and who played a key role in unsuccessful legal efforts to overturn the results of the election. After 22 days without a speaker,. House. Republicans came together to elect. Johnson for the post. Wednesday after three other better-known nominees failed to unite the fractured conference. Johnson, 51 years old, represents. Louisiana's deep-red fourth district, in the state's northwest that includes. Shreveport, where he grew up. Johnson is the son of a firefighter who was critically burned and disabled in the line of duty. He is the father of four children of his own. Johnson was elected to. Congress in after serving in the. Louisiana state legislature. He has been an attorney with a focus on social conservative issues, including defending the state's same-sex marriage ban before the. Louisiana. Supreme. Court. His opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion along with support for religious freedoms has continued to guide him as a legislator. As vice chairman of the. House. Republican. Conference,. Johnson was one of seven elected leaders for the party. However, he was seen as far enough removed from the top positions that members looking for new leadershipeven more moderate lawmakers who might differ with him on some issueswere supportive of him taking over. \"Mike. Johnson is a person who. I think everybody respects, he's a very principled human being,\" said. Rep. Mario. Diaz. Balart. R.,. Fla.. House. Republicans elected. Rep. Mike. Johnson of. Louisiana as speaker of the. House on. Wednesday, more than three weeks after. Kevin. McCarthy was. Gaetz. R.,. Fla. has been seatmates with. Johnson since the two were both elected in and has served with him on the oversight and armed services committees. \"He is not swampy,\" said. Gaetz, who launched the vote that first ousted former. House. Speaker. Kevin. McCarthy. R.,. Calif.. \"He is not beholden to the lobbyists and special interests. Even when we disagree, it comes from a place of sincerity, not whoever's donated to his campaign.\". Democrats called. Johnson an extremist. They said his opposition to abortion and efforts to overturn the election results had been losing issues for. Republicans in the election. When at least one. Republican who will have a tough election next year voted for. Johnson, a. Democratic voice could be heard shouting \"Bye! Bye!\". NEWSLETTER. SIGN-UP. Get email notifications about major political news, from campaigns to the. Capitol. Rep. Pete. Aguilar. D.,. Calif., the chair of the. House. Democratic. Caucus, said on the. House floor. Wednesday that. Republicans were choosing a person who \"can pass their extreme litmus test to oppose marriage equality, enact a nationwide abortion ban without exceptions, gut. Social. Security and. Medicare, support overturning a free and fair election.\". Aguilar said. Johnson had been called \"the most important architect of the electoral college objections,\" and a. Republican member shouted \"damn right.\". On paper,. Johnson will mark a break from the prior. House. Republican leadership team. McCarthy, along with. House. Majority. Leader. Steve. Scalise. R.,. La. and. House. Majority. Whip. Tom. Emmer. R.,. Minn. all voted for the stopgap measure that is keeping the government funded through. Nov. 17. All three also voted for 40 billion in aid to. Ukraine in , and again this year for about 300 million toward the. Ukraine. Security. Assistance. Initiative. Johnson voted against those measures. Rep. Mike. Johnson, center, with. Rep. Matt. Gaetz in. Washington in . Now that. Johnson is speaker, the question is how firmly rooted. Johnson's beliefs are about those funds, or whether he is part of a perennial \"vote no, hope yes\" caucus. In a letter to his colleagues,. Johnson proposed advancing a temporary spending measure until either. Jan. 15 or. April 15depending on what the conference would support, while working to advance the eight individual appropriations bills that haven't yet cleared the. House. Without a stopgap measure, the government is set to run out of money next month. For next year, he proposed passing a fiscal budget resolution keeping the. House in session during. August if the. House hadn't passed all of its fiscal appropriations bills . When he served as head of the. Republican. Study. Committee, which represents a spectrum of. House conservatives,. Johnson presided over a budget blueprint designed to balance the federal budget in 10 years. Among other things, it pushed an idea long associated with former. House. Speaker. Paul. Ryan. R.,. Wis. to turn. Medicare into a \"premium support\" system in which beneficiaries would receive financial assistance to buy health insurance through a regulated. Medicare exchange. The plan also proposed raising the retirement age to 69. For people born in and later, the current retirement age is 67. Johnson has been a strong supporter of former. President. Donald. Trump, who on. Wednesday morning urged. Republicans to support. Johnson. Johnson has played a key role pushing. Trump's false claims of election fraud. In ,. Johnson organized an amicus brief signed by 126. House. Republicans supporting a lawsuit filed by. Texas' attorney general arguing that. Texas could challenge the election results in four swing states won . The conservative. Supreme. Court rejected the lawsuit. At the time,. Johnson heavily lobbied fellow. Republicans to sign onto the letter, suggesting that. Trump would be watching to see who signed, which some members took as a threat. At the time,. Democrats were so upset that one member,. Rep. Bill. Pascrell. D.,. N.J. argued that then-House. Speaker. Nancy. Pelosi. D.,. Calif. should bar the. GOP signatories from taking their seats, saying that they were attempting to \"obliterate public confidence in our democratic system\" \"unelected dictator.\". Johnson also joined with 146 other. Republicans in voting against certification of the election results. The push to overturn. Biden's victory has led to legal peril for the former president. Johnson's selection as the party nominee took place the same day that one of. Trump's lawyers,. Jenna. Ellis, became the third legal adviser to plead guilty in the. Georgia racketeering case involving. Trump's efforts. President. Donald. Trump greeted. Rep. Mike. Johnson ahead of his. State of the. Union address in . When a reporter asked. Johnson at a press conference. Tuesday night about his effort to overturn the election, she was shouted down. Johnson's colleagues, with. Rep. Virginia. Foxx. R.,. N.C. telling the reporter \"Shut up! Shut up!\". In the lead-up to. Johnson's election,. Republicans had rallied around three other speaker nominees who all ultimately dropped out of the running after it became clear there wasn't enough support to be elected on the. House floor. For. Rep. Jim. Jordan. R.,. Ohio, a conservative with many similar stances to. Johnson's, some moderate. Republicans said they couldn't back him because of past positions he had taken which they viewed as out of the mainstream. However, they were united in backing. Johnson, who is seen as more personable and less combative than. Jordan. Though. Gaetz considers. Jordan a mentor, to him, a. Speaker. Johnson is an even better outcome \"I get the best of. Jordan's brilliance and dogged commitment to oversight with a government funding strategy more closely tailored to my vision,\". Gaetz said. Rep. Ken. Buck. R.,. Colo. who said he wouldn't be able to support. Jordan because of the election issue, backed. Johnson for the post. Buck justified his support for. Johnson \"I think it is a mistake, but. I think people make mistakes and still can be really good speakers,\" he said about. Johnson and . Johnson isn't known for bipartisanship. He was ranked 429th out of 435 lawmakers in the bipartisan index kept. Center and the. McCourt. School of. Public. Policy at. Georgetown. University, situated among members of the staunchly conservative. House. Freedom. Caucus. The measure scores how well members of opposite parties work together using bill sponsorship data. The lobbying arm of the. Heritage. Foundation, a conservative. Washington think tank, gives. Johnson a lifetime score of 90 for his voting record. Johnson has proposed legislation on issues central to. Republicans' policy agenda, including a bill that would make it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion. He is strongly opposed to abortion access. Another proposal would cut off federal funding to any school district, museum or other organization that exposes a child younger than 10 to the topic of gender identity or sexual orientation, enabling parents to sue over violations. Johnson has called for restrictions on medical interventions, such as surgery, for transgender youth. Conservatives say children are too young to access care with lasting consequences based on a self-diagnosis. Democrats say medical interventions provide necessary relief to youth struggling to manage deep distress. Clinicians who defend providing gender-affirming care to minors say there is more harm in denying the care to youth and that the matter has been subject to extensive study and research. Rep. Mike. Johnson was elected. Republicans after 22 days without a speaker. Johnson opposed a congressional push to ratify an amendment mandating equal rights for both men and women, saying he opposed it because he was concerned it could restrict abortion regulations. Some critics of the. Equal. Rights. Amendment have said they worry restricting federal funds for abortions could be struck down under the. ERA because only women can get pregnant. Its proponents disputed that its passage would automatically undermine all such limits. Johnson will have a long way to go on the fundraising front to match. McCarthy, who he was ousted had already pulled in tens of millions of dollars for the election on behalf of. House. Republicans, including for the. National. Republican. Congressional. Committee. For his own accounts,. McCarthy brought in more than 14 million between. January and. September,. Federal. Election. Commission data show, leaving the former speaker's campaign with about 10.6 million cash on hand. Meanwhile,. Johnson has brought in roughly 550,000 this cycle for his re-election effort, federal campaign finance data show. Contributors to one of his fundraising arms mostly included executives at logistics firms in his congressional district, as well as retirees. Johnson raised a little more than 1.2 million on average each election cycle since running for. Congress in , and his campaign has about 1.1 million in the bank as of late. September. Johnson also has few financial assets, recent disclosures show. He earned about 29,800 in income from online courses he taught at. Liberty. University, the evangelical. Christian institution founded. Jerry. Falwell. Sr. He also has few debts, including only a home mortgage valued between 250,000 and 500,000, a small personal loan and a home equity line of credit. His salary as speaker will increase to 223,500, up from the 174,000 he has earned as a rank-and-file member. Jack. Gillum,. Kristina. Peterson, and. Molly. Ball contributed to this article.",

         "business",
         "3 min. T-Mobile has avoided some of its competitors' steeper rate increases. said it is scrapping a program that would have forced some customers into more expensive wireless plans after the proposed changes triggered heavy blowback. started training its support staff to respond to customer questions. The carrier said it planned to shift a small number of people to newer service tiers unless they opted out company. The newer plans would have offered more features but generally cost customers an additional 5 to 10 per line. \"I think we've learned that particular test cell isn't something that our customers are going to love,\". Chief. Executive. Mike. Sievert said. Wednesday during the company's third-quarter earnings call. \"We had planned it as a test cell, and then we aren't doing it, because. I think we've got plenty of feedback.\". The reversal comes as the nation's second-largest wireless carrier continues to mature following its takeover of. Sprint. The company counted nearly 118 million customers, including high-speed internet users and connections for smart devices, in the third quarter. T-Mobile has had a freer hand to adjust its wireless plans since many of the state and federal agreements tied to the takeover expired earlier this year. The company has avoided some of its competitors' steeper rate increasesthough it has at times raised feesas it continues to seek government officials' approval on other matters. T-Mobile planned to start notifying customers about the potential service changes last week. Sievert later said in a message to employees that the program hadn't yet launched but would start informing customers \"in the near future.\". By. Wednesday, the company said those notifications won't go out at all. Mike. Katz,. T-Mobile's marketing president, said the company will keep experimenting with new price strategies to simplify its offerings. Verizon earlier this year reduced the number of unlimited data plans it offersand removed some add-on featuresin a bid to make them less confusing and reinvigorate revenue growth. Other companies have simply raised older plans' prices to persuade customers to upgrade to newer plans that cost more but at least offer more features. Verizon this week said its decisions to increase rates and end some discounts, which the company calls \"targeted pricing actions,\" were expected to add 1 billion to revenue this year. Will.

Armenian leader said in an interview. He added that, because of this record, he doesn't see any advantages in the continuing presence of. Russian military bases in. Armenia. The predicament facing. Armenia increasingly worries the. U.S. and. Western allies. In a world already ravaged by violence, from. Ukraine to. Gaza, the region is looming as yet another potentially explosive flashpoint in a long arc of instability that runs through. Eurasia. While the conflict was until now focused on. Nagorno-Karabakh, a region that was controlled internationally recognized as part of. Azerbaijan,. Western officials say they fear that it may now spread into. Armenia proper. Azerbaijani. President. Ilham. Aliyev has repeatedly described most of. Armenia, including the capital,. Yerevan, as historically. Azerbaijani lands that should be recovered. Even though he recently stated that. Azerbaijan has no territorial claims on. Armenia, officials and state-controlled media in. Baku continue referring to most of. Armenia as \"Western. Azerbaijan.\". Aliyev on. Wednesday canceled plans to meet. Pashinyan for talks later this month in. Brussels. A growing concern in. Washington and. European capitals is that. Azerbaijan, with. Turkish support and. Russian complicity, may attempt to conquer all or parts of. Armenia in the coming months, creating a land bridge between. Azerbaijan and. Turkey. A parallel worry is that. Russia, whose state media and officials have begun a vitriolic campaign against. Pashinyan, may be planning a coup to oust the country's leader. \"Territorial integrity of. Armenia could be in jeopardy, and also its democracy,\" warned. Lithuanian. Foreign. Minister. Gabrielius. Landsbergis. \"The symbol and the principal flag-bearer of democracy in. Armenia is.

Russian-guaranteed cease-fire collapsed in. September, as. Azerbaijan's military seized. Nagorno-Karabakh with little resistance, forcing almost all of the enclave's 100,000 ethnic. Armenians to flee their homeland. Pashinyan's criticism of. Moscow's behavior, in particular in a speech at the. European. Parliament this month, has inflamed. Russian wrath. So did. Armenia's decision this month to ratify the jurisdiction of the. International. Criminal. Court, which has issued an arrest warrant against. Putin for alleged war crimes in. Ukraine. Russia's. TASS state news agency, citing a high-placed official, described. Pashinyan as rapidly following the path of. Ukrainian. President. Volodymyr. Zelensky and trying to turn. Armenia \"into another. Ukraine.\". Russian state. TV has aired a special called \"Nikol. Pashinyan, the harbinger of disaster.\". Former. President. Dmitry. Medvedev, the deputy head of. Russia's national security council, blasted. Pashinyan on social media, adding ominously \"Guess what fate awaits him.\". Prime. Minister. Nikol. Pashinyan attending a parliamentary session in. Yerevan. Asked about whether he was concerned , and whether he feared that. Moscow may be seeking to oust him,. Pashinyan didn't disguise his frustration. \"Such an approach violates many rules, starting with non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and diplomatic correctness,\" he said. Ara. Papian, a former. Armenian ambassador to. Canada and a leader of a pro-Western party, said that only deeper security ties with the. U.S. and. France, two nations with large. Armenian diasporas, could allow his country to survive given the changing regional environmentand. Moscow's new weakness. \"It's not in. Russia's interests to back. Armenia,\" he said. \"And even if it wanted to defend. Armenia, it wouldn't be able to, given that all its resources are concentrated on the. Ukrainian front.\". Continuing. Armenian membership in the. Russian-led military bloc, the. Collective. Security. Treaty. Organization, creates obstacles to deepening military ties with the. West, he added. Despite these limitations, the. U.S. last month conducted the. Eagle. Partner exercise with. Armenian forces involving some 85. U.S. personnel, focused on training for peacekeeping missions. A looming existential threat means that the country must avoid an outright break with. Moscow, said. Vahe. Hovhannisyan, a former lawmaker and a leader of the. Alternative. Projects. Group opposition platform. \"Completely spoiling relations with. Russia without getting any. Western guarantees about national security and about preventing a. Turkish-Azerbaijani military invasion? This is a direct path to suicide,\" he said. \"We cannot turn. Russia into an enemy. Yes, it may not be a good ally. But it can be a formidable foe.\". Geography limits. Armenia's options. The country has only two relatively friendly neighborsIran, which is already engaged in a global confrontation with the. U.S., and. Georgia, whose government is close to. Russia and. Turkey. \"Armenians find themselves learning, one more time, the lessons of realpolitik,\" said. Arthur. Khachikyan, a professor of international relations at the. Russian-Armenian. University in. Yerevan. \"We have this central conflict between the. West and. Russia. Both sides are trying to woo. Turkey because it has a lot of resources, and both sides are willing to work with. Turkey and. Azerbaijan and not confront them. This is where we fall through the cracks.\". Arthur. Khachikyan, a professor of international relations, says. Armenians are learning the lessons of realpolitik. In the interview,. Pashinyan said he remains optimistic about the prospects for a peace settlement with. Azerbaijan in the coming months. The region's future, he said, should be in opening long-closed borders and trade routes, including a land connection between. Azerbaijan and. Turkey through. Armenia as long as it respects. Armenian sovereignty. \"Security should not be achieved through the army alone, but also through regional peace,\" he said. Asked about the country's historic relationship with. Russia,. Pashinyan urged to focus instead on. Armenia's much longer history with its. Turkic neighbors,. Turkey and. Azerbaijan. \"This is where all the questions lie, and this is where the answers to all the questions lie,\" he said. \"We should work first to improve our regional relations.\". The diversification of security relationships that. Armenia seeks, he added, should be understood as a quest for lasting regional peace rather than just a plea for. Western military bases and weapons. Appeared in the. October 26, , print edition as 'Armenia. Is. Seeking. Support. From. West. As. Russian. Ties. Fray'.",

At the end of a marathon day of internal debate and votes,. Johnson, the vice chairman of the. House. Republican conference, bested. Byron. Donalds of. Florida, a. Trump ally popular with many of the. House's most conservative lawmakers. In a shift, lawmakers left the. Capitol on. Tuesday night optimistic that. Johnson could unite them after a series of failed attempts to find a successor to former. House. Speaker. Kevin. McCarthy. R.,. Calif., who was ousted three weeks ago. The. House is frozen until a new speaker is elected. Lawmakers are eager to get back to work, with many wanting to pass aid to. Israel and address a looming government-funding deadline next month. A floor vote could be held as soon as noon. Wednesday. NEWSLETTER. SIGN-UP. Get email notifications about major political news, from campaigns to the. Capitol. Johnson's ascension marked the last chapter in a dizzying day, as. Republicans' divisions and the power of its most conservative members to steer the party were thrust into the spotlight once again. House. Majority. Whip. Tom. Emmer. R.,. Minn. was chosen as the nominee around lunchtime but dropped his bid by dinner, as resistance from hard-right members buttressed. Donald. Trump sank his chances. By contrast, lawmakers said. Johnson benefited from not being considered part of the core. GOP leadership team, whose decisions about policy issues including the debt limit and spending levels have divided. House. Republicans. Those disagreements culminated in. McCarthy's removal and have hobbled efforts to find a replacement. \"The conference just wanted something new. They did not want the old,\" said. Rep. Jodey. Arrington. R.,. Texas. He said that. House. Republicans first had to consider other members of. GOP leadership before landing on. Johnson. Johnson also appeared to have won over at least some lawmakers who had thrown up roadblocks before, including. Rep. Matt. Gaetz. R.,. Fla., who led the charge to oust. McCarthy. Gaetz said he believed. Johnson had \"enthusiastic support\" across the party. Rep. Chip. Roy. R.,. Texas said. Johnson was \"the right guy at the right time.\". Emmer's withdrawal had put the. Republicans back to square one for the fourth time, another reset after similar defeats for. Reps. Steve. Scalise. R.,. La. and. Jim. Jordan. R.,. Ohio in recent weeks. Republicans regrouped again late. Tuesday to assemble another slate of candidates and hold a fresh vote. House. Majority. Whip. Tom. Emmer's withdrawal from the speakership bid had put the. Republicans back at square one. New nominee. Johnson previously led the. Republican. Study. Committee, a broad group of conservative members, but has less experience in leadership than the previous three speaker picks. The 51-year-old joined. Congress in and serves on the. House. Judiciary. Committee. In a sign of frustration over a long and messy process that pitted factions of the. GOP against each other, the tally in the final round was 128 for. Johnson, to 29 for. Donalds, with 44 protest votes for \"other\"all but one for. McCarthy. The other candidates to be eliminated or drop out in earlier rounds were. GOP. Rep. Roger. Williams of. Texas and two. Tennessee. Republicans,. Mark. Green and. Chuck. Fleischmann. A -up round of voting designed to see if lawmakers would support. Johnson on the. House floor didn't raise any immediate red flags. Lawmakers said everyone voted for. Johnson, with three voting \"present.\". There were about 20 absences, meaning opposition could still emerge. Chants of \"Mike,. Mike,. Mike\" could be heard from the room. Any candidate for speaker needs a majority of votes in the 433-member. House, assuming all members vote for an individual. Republicans currently hold 221 seats compared with 212 for. Democrats. No. Republican can lose more than four. GOP votes to be elected speaker, assuming all. Democrats vote for their candidate,. Rep. Hakeem. Jeffries. D.,. N.Y.. Rep. Jim. Jordan of. Ohio was removed as. GOP nominee for speaker in a secret ballot after he lost his third. McCarthy, the previous speaker, was ousted three weeks ago. Earlier,. House. Republicans picked. Emmer, a former chairman of the. House. Republicans' campaign arm, over fellow finalist. Johnson, following a rapid-fire series of votes to winnow an initial group of more than a half dozen hopefuls. The tally in the final round was 117 for. Emmer to 97 for. Johnson. The close finish immediately raised questions about whether. Emmer could assemble the 217 votes on the. House floor needed to become speaker. After. Emmer won the nod, more than 20 members indicated they wouldn't support him, including some members of the. House. Freedom. Caucus who pulled for. Jordan last week. Trump, who is close to. Jordan, issued a statement after the. GOP vote saying that electing. Emmer speaker would be a \"tragic mistake,\" painting him as. Republican in name only and insufficiently deferential to. Trump and his movement. Rep. Jim. Banks. R.,. Ind., who last. November lost to. Emmer in the race for majority whip, said that. Emmer would never be able to win over sufficient holdouts, given a voting record that he characterized as too moderate. Emmer voted to enshrine federal protections for same-sex couples, and also this year supported a debt-ceiling deal and a stopgap spending bill to avoid a shutdown, putting him at odds with many conservatives. The party has been trying to move beyond a bitter cycle of recriminations. After. McCarthy said he wouldn't run again, a group of. Republicans backing. Jordan blocked. Scalise from winning the seat. The bitter feelings from that episode led some. Scalise supporters to then vote against elevating. Jordan, a rift that widened when some lawmakers said they had received threats of. GOP primary challenges or even physical harm from. Jordan supporters. Lindsay. Wise contributed to this article. \"I don't think we've hit rock bottom yet,\" said. Rep. Max. Miller. R.,. Ohio.

         "Exxon,. Chevron. Invest in the. West as. Global. Conflicts. Increase. Major oil companies are increasingly turning their attention to. Western. Hemisphere locations such as this. Chevron site in. Kersey,. Colo. LIZ. HAMPTONREUTERS 7 minutes. As the world becomes more dangerous, the two largest. Western crude producers are focusing their investments closer to home. in a 53 billion deal that gives it access to one of this century's biggest oil finds in the. South. American country of. Guyana and allows it to double down on shale presence to. North. Dakota. Both regions are established oil producers with limited geopolitical tensions, affording. Chevron new reserves with fewer risks. The deal follows a megadeal in the. U.S. shale patch , which this month acquired. Pioneer. Natural. Resources in a 60 billion merger that anchors its future to the prolific. Permian. Basin of. West. Texas and. New. Mexico. The back-to-back acquisitions signal that the oil majors are increasingly turning their attention to the. Western. Hemisphere as international investments are complicated of expanding regional conflicts, from. Ukraine to the. Middle. East. The escalating war between. Israel and. Hamas is a reminder of the risks of operating in a region marred by violence. A. Pioneer. Natural. Resources pump jack near. Midland,. Texas. The company was acquired a 60 billion merger. In a call with analysts to discuss the. Pioneer deal earlier this month,. Exxon. Chief. Executive. Darren. Woods said that diversification allowed the company to manage geopolitical risks but that. Exxon also had to make sure that it had access to low-cost production, including in the. U.S. Chevron's announcement was made two weeks after. Israel ordered the company to shut down natural-gas production at one of its two major offshore platforms in the. Eastern. Mediterranean. Sea as the war between. Israel and. Hamas escalated. The order was a reminder of the risks oil majors face in a region marred has previously jeopardized ambitious energy projects. The companies also face investors' demands that they focus on returns and steer away from the potentially profitable but costly and risky frontier exploration of untested regions that vaulted them to their global status. \"The age of frontier basin, breakthrough basin exploration may be done,\" said. Raoul. LeBlanc, an analyst at. SP. Global. Commodity. Insights. Exxon and. Chevron built their businesses for decades globe for exploration opportunities as investors pressured the companies to add to their booked reserves, a key metric used value the producers. As a result, oil giants operated in far-flung locales rife with what is known in industry parlance as aboveground risk. The emergence of. U.S. shale eased some of the pressure as companies were able to drill in their own backyards, where frackers didn't have to worry about wars or sudden regime changes. Exxon once cultivated ties with. Russian. President. Vladimir. Putin but the. Kremlin wiped out the company's stake in a major oil-and-gas project. In recent years, large. Western oil companies have packed up and left places such as. Southeast. Asia,. West. Africa,. Russia and parts of. Latin. America. Exxon has planned since to sell at least 15 billion worth of assets as it shrinks its global footprint and focuses on its more valuable assets. It has sold out of projects in. Chad and. Cameroon and made progress on its goal to shed additional holdings in. Iraq and. Nigeria. The company pulled out of. Russia, where it had spent years establishing a foothold, once cultivating ties with. Russian. President. Vladimir. Putin. The. Kremlin wiped out. Exxon's stake in a major oil-and-gas project there after the company tried to exit from the venture following. Russia's invasion of. Ukraine. Meanwhile,. Chevron since has unloaded assets in. Azerbaijan,. Denmark, the. U.K. and. Brazil, among other places. As the companies have retreated, their overall production volumes have shrunk. Exxon produced about 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent a day last year, down about 17 from , its annual peak. Chevron's international output fell 3 last year after concessions in. Thailand and. Indonesia expired. Following the. Pioneer deal, about 45 of. Exxon's production will come from the. U.S., up from roughly 31 before it, according to. JPMorgan. Chase. Both. Exxon and. Chevron said their recent shale acquisitions would strengthen. U.S. energy security, reflecting concerns that oil supplies may become harder to come rages in. Ukraine and diplomats rush to the. Middle. East to try to prevent a regional conflagration involving. Israel and. Iran-backed forces. Guyana's relatively stable political situation attracts oil companies, and the country has shown respect for contracts for oil concessions. Guyana's proximity to the. U.S. and relatively stable politics are similarly appealing to the oil companies. The country has exhibited respect for contracts for oil concessions there, allowing. Exxon and. Chevron to tout their investments as low-risk projects that will deliver new oil barrels to the. U.S., potentially lowering gasoline prices, analysts said. \"This gives you, as majors, an important foothold in regions that are also of strategic importance for the. U.S.,\". Carolyn. Kissane, a clinical professor at. New. York. University's. Center for. Global. Affairs, said of the recent deals. President. Biden ran on a platform to stop new oil production but encouraged companies to drill more after the war began in. Ukraine, which pushed gasoline to record levels. Earlier this year, he approved. ConocoPhillips's massive. Willow oil-and-gas project in the. U.S. Arctic. The decision angered environmentalists but sent a signal to producers that the administration likely wouldn't skewer them for making fossil fuel investments close to home. Chevron and. Exxon have played down concerns that. U.S. antitrust regulators would block either deal, saying the tie-ups will benefit consumers energy supplies. Exxon and its partners,. Hess and. China's. Cnooc, have revved up. Guyana's oil production from nothing in to 400,000 barrels a day. The partners expect to be pumping 1.2 million barrels a day by , making it one of the world's fastest-ever oil developments. Hess owns nearly a one-third of the estimated 11 billion barrels of oil and gas found off the shores of. Guyana. ,. Chevron also gains a foothold in. North. Dakota's. Bakken. Shale, a mature basin where relatively few investments are required to maintain production, said. SP's. LeBlanc. Hess produced 181,000 barrels of oil and gas a day in the region in the second quarter of the year. Exxon and its partners,. Hess and. China's. Cnooc, have revved up. Guyana's oil production from nothing in to 400,000 barrels a day. The companies say that skills learned in challenging regions to domestic provinces, they will be able to recover more oil. Exxon said it now expected to produce about 2 million barrels of oil and gas a day in the. Permian by , in part lateral wells. \"The game now is about investing large amounts of dollars for a low-risk asset,\". LeBlanc said. Appeared in the. October 26, , print edition as 'Exxon,. Chevron.

         "Clarence. Thomas. Didn't. Fully. Repay 267,230. Loan for. Luxury. Motor. Home,. Senate. Report. Says. Oct. 25, 958 pm. ET 4 min. Justice. Clarence. Thomas hasn't disclosed his tax returns, so it isn't publicly known whether he reported any income related to the vehicle. WASHINGTONSupreme. Court. Justice. Clarence. Thomas didn't report on required financial disclosure forms that a friend forgave some or all of a 267,230 loan, according to a report released. Wednesday. Committee. Chairman. Ron. Wyden. \"The new evidence obtained raises a number of potentially serious tax questions for. Justice. Thomas,'' said the report prepared 's. Democratic staff. Thomas and his wife. Virginia borrowed the money from. Anthony. Welters, a longtime friend who with. Thomas came up in the. Black conservative movement, to purchase a luxury motor coach in , according to the report. \"This is a 267,000 transaction that has been kept secret for decades. Finance. Committee members are finding out the details at the same time as everyone else,\" said. Wyden. D.,. Ore.. \"Justice. Thomas should inform the committee whether he reported this forgiven loan on his tax returns and paid all income taxes owed.\". Thomas's lawyer,. Elliot. Berke, disputed. Wyden's report. \"The loan was never forgiven. Any suggestion to the contrary is false. The. Thomases made all payments to. Mr. Welters on a regular basis until the terms of the agreement were satisfied in full,\". Berke said. The report is the latest disclosure that adds to the scrutiny faced accepting free trips and other financial dealings with conservative billionaires. He has vigorously defended not disclosing those matters in past years, saying omissions were due to inadvertent mistakes or legal guidance then in effect. Wyden released a four-page report on documents turned over by. Welters, who made a fortune in the healthcare industry and later became a director of the. Carlyle. Group investment firm. The report says that documents indicate that. Welters forgave the principal of the loan in after. Thomas made at least one annual interest payment of 20,042. Thomas has used the vehicle to vacation and to build an image that he is a man of simple tastes with affinity for regular people. \"You get to go to. Walmart parking lots and truck stops. Most people pass a. Flying. J truck stop, a. TA,. Love's, never think twice of it,\". Thomas, 75 years old and the current court's longest serving justice, said in a documentary. \"But for us, we've been there.\". A series of press reports has revealed a side of. Thomas's lifestyle built on the largess of wealthy figures who have given him vacations and provided financial assistance. In. August, the. New. York. Times reported that. Thomas had purchased the used 40-foot-long. Prevost. Le. Mirage. XL. Marathon recreational vehicle with money borrowed from. Welters, who told the publication that the loan had been satisfied but didn't say whether it had been repaid or forgiven. Under the tax code, gifts and loan proceeds aren't taxable income. But when a debt is forgiven, the borrower generally must include that amount as income and pay taxes on it. Thomas hasn't disclosed his tax returns, so it isn't publicly known whether he reported any income related to the vehicle. In general, the. Internal. Revenue. Service has three years to audit a return once it is filed and six years for significant omissions of income. It is unlikely that. Thomas would owe the government money now because of the time that has passed. As chairman of the. Finance. Committee,. Wyden can request any taxpayer's returns and audit records from the. IRS. Committee aides declined to say whether such a request had been made, but. Wyden said his findings would be shared with the. Senate. Judiciary. Committee \"to evaluate the ethics implications.\". Disclosures regarding. Thomas's conduct, along with that of some other justices, have heightened scrutiny on the. Supreme. Court's ethics rules. Unlike other courts, the. Supreme. Court has no code of conduct spelling out standards above the minimum necessary to comply with federal law. Under bipartisan pressure from the. Senate, several justices have said the court is considering whether to adopt such a code. Bags of. Cash. From. Drug. Cartels. Flood. Teller. Windows at. U.S. Banks. European. Navies. Leave the.

         "Regulatory ‘guidance’ tells banks to fret about unknowable risks.",
         "opinion",
         "REVIEW. OUTLOOK 408 4 min. There's no shortage of risks to keep bankers up at night. Rising interest rates, wars, commercial real estate, a weakening. Chinese economy. Yet financial regulators want banks to focus ondrum roll, pleaseclimate change. 2254 1x. The. Federal. Reserve,. Federal. Deposit. Insurance. Corp., and. Comptroller of the. Currency on. Tuesday published guidance directing banks on how to manage putative climate risks. The agencies say they aren't dictating how banks lend to accelerate the shift to a lower-carbon economy. But reading between the lines, that's exactly what they're doing. The guidance says banks must manage their balance sheets for physical risks from climate change, such as flooding or drought, as well as the \"stresses to institutions or sectors arising from the shifts in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated with the changes that would be part of a transition to a lower carbon economy.\". In other words, banks will need to consider their lending priorities with the climate lobby's preferred policies and predictions in mind, whether or not those predictions are likely to happen. That would mean reducing exposure to fossil fuels because. President. Biden has set a goal of eliminating carbon emissions from the power grid by and achieving a \"net-zero\" economy by . Banks will also have to conduct a \"climate-related scenario analysis\"don't call them stress teststhat extend \"beyond the financial institution's typical strategic planning horizon\" and account for potential losses in \"extreme but plausible scenarios.\". Does this mean anticipating a melting. Antarctica? What's extreme and what's plausible is far from clear. As. Fed. Governor. Michelle. Bowman notes in dissent, long-dated predictions \"are likely to be highly speculative\" and \"of limited or no utility to the bank in managing risk.\". Banks must hedge all kinds of risks, so why are regulators singling out climate for special treatment? Perhaps because their goal is to pressure banks to finance the left's green-energy transition. Regulators aren't expressly dictating which industries banks lend or don't lend to, but examiners will review and grade them on how well they manage putative climate risks. Banks could get penalized if examiners give them bad marks. The guidance also says management should set \"lending limits related to material climate-related financial risks\" and consider \"the evolving legal and regulatory landscape.\". That sure sounds like a warning to limit fossil-fuel financing. Bank boards must \"challenge management's assessments and recommendations\" on climate, regulators say, and \"encourage management to consider climate-related financial risk impacts on the financial institution's other operational and legal risks.\". The clear implication is that banks risk getting sued for not doing enough to address climate change. Fed. Chair. Jerome. Powell, who voted for the guidance, in a statement said \"it is not the. Fed's role to tell banks which businesses they can and cannot lend to, and this guidance is not intended to do so,\" adding the \"Federal. Reserve is not and will not be a 'climate policymaker.'\". That's nice to hear, but regional. Fed banks will be implementing the new policy. Regulators are clearly telling banks and their examiners they need to spend more time and resources prioritizing climate even if there are more material and immediate financial risks. Bags of. Cash.

         "GOP agitators will have to give him leeway they denied Kevin McCarthy.",
         "opinion",
         "REVIEW. OUTLOOK. Oct. 25, 641 pm. ET 4 min. Rep. Mike. Johnson. R-La. on. Wednesday. After three weeks of pointless but embarrassing intrigue,. House. Republicans finally hit on a consensus nominee for. Speaker. Congratulations to 51-year-old. Louisiana. Rep. Mike. Johnson, who with a 220-209 vote. Wednesday won the unenviable job of herding the cats, snakes and peacocks in the. GOP menagerie. 2254 1x. The question is whether the. Republican malcontents will let him govern in a way they refused his deposed predecessor,. Kevin. McCarthy. It won't take long to find out. Government funding expires. Nov. 17, and. America's friends in. Israel,. Ukraine and. Taiwan need military help to defend themselves. Mr. Johnson was first elected in , representing a district that voted for. Donald. Trump . The optimistic case is that he might have the credibility on the right to get the. GOP's narrow majority to accept the modest wins of divided government. Maybe it will take a. Speaker like. Mr. Johnson to convince the disruptive. Republican rump that accepting partial victory is better than a government shutdown or an eventual spending omnibus. Mr. McCarthy did the. GOP a favor by averting a shutdown that would have backfired on. Republicans, but he needed. Democratic votes to pass a 45-day spending bill. That was the excuse used to justify the revolt against him, though personal animus was the real driver. In a letter this week,. Mr. Johnson proposed a roadmap for passing spending bills, with a potential stopgap extension through early next year to gain the time to do it. Good luck and. Godspeed. A second priority is rebuilding military deterrence, including arms for. Israel,. Ukraine and was an early opponent of assistance to. Kyiv. After voting against a 40 billion package last year, he offered a litany of red herrings, such as that \"our own border is in chaos,\" and \"mothers are struggling to find baby formula.\". Such problems have nothing to do with the. U.S. interest in deterring. Vladimir. Putin's. Russian imperialism. Most of. Mr. Johnson's. GOP colleagues see that, and his broader role as. Speaker should take this into account, even if mounting evidence of a. Russia-Iran axis hasn't changed his mind. Another part of. Mr. Johnson's job will be below the surface, and that's where his predecessor did some of his best had a record of recruiting. Republicans with diverse backgrounds to become candidates for office, which is pivotal for winning and keeping a lacks a record as a major fundraiser, which was another. McCarthy strength. Democrats are already branding. Mr. Johnson a. MAGA ideologue, which is unfair. But he will have to explain his view of the election, given that he pushed an implausible lawsuit at the time asking the. Supreme. Court to decertify results in four swing states. When a reporter. Tuesday tried to ask him a question on that,. Republicans hooted it down, which isn't a great start for retaking the suburbs. On the other hand,. Mr. Johnson wrote a \"Commitment to. Civility\" that was signed in his fellow freshmen. In a brief. House speech. Wednesday, he came off as gracious, funny and smart, and if he continues in this tenor, he will be an asset for the. GOP. Whatever the. McCarthy mutineers might say, the three weeks of turmoil have hurt the. GOP's image as a party that can competently govern while acting as a political check on. Mr. Biden. A big part of. Mr. Johnson's job is to bring order to this. Republican chaos. The hard reality is that the. GOP's narrow majority puts him in the same precarious position as his predecessor. If the agitators want. Speaker. Johnson to succeed, and voters to keep them in power, they will spend the coming days working to fund the government and pocketing incremental conservative wins. If they don't, they deserve to lose, and they probably will. Wonder. Land. If control of both the. House and. Senate returns to the. Democratic left in ,. Matt. Gaetz and his seven.

         "REVIEW. OUTLOOK. Oct. 25, 640 pm. ET 178 3 min. Illinois. Gov. J.B. Pritzker l. Illinois. Gov. J.B. Pritzker says he wants his state to continue its. Invest in. Kids scholarship program, but only if he doesn't have to spend political capital to pass it. That's the message between the lines of his statement last week that he wouldn't block the program, which gives scholarships to more than 9,000 low-income students, if someone else in. Springfield can make it happen. 2254 1x \"I will support it if it comes to my desk to extend the program in whatever form,\". Mr. Pritzker said. \"I mean,. I can't imagine it would show up in some form that. I would be unwilling to. But again, the reality is that the legislature needs to go through this process.\". Illinoisans don't need the refresher on how a bill becomes a law, but they do need the. Governor to do more than duck and cover. He could start in. Springfield to renew the program during their six-day veto session that begins this week. Under amended legislation filed. Tuesday, the program would be cut back to reduce the overall tax credit available to 50 million from 75 million. Contributions up to 5,000 would qualify for a 100 tax credit. Contributions over 5,000 would have their tax credit reduced to 55 from 75. Donations over 5,000 earmarked for children in areas designated as \"underserved\". Department of. Commerce and. Economic. Opportunity would qualify for a 65 tax credit. Those areas have 35 of children living below 130 of the poverty line. The tax credit adjustments are painful reductions, but. Democrats in. Springfield will support the renewal if they read the polls because it's popular. A recent survey from the. Illinois. Policy. Institute shows 59 of. Democrats support. Invest in. Kids with 28 opposed. Support is 65 among black. Illinoisans and 61 among. Hispanics. The program has a waiting list of 30,000 students. The political obstacle as ever is the teachers unions that don't want competition for the failing public schools they control. In , 32 of. Illinois 8th graders were proficient in reading and 29 could not read at the \"basic\" level for their grade. Only 26 were proficient in math and 38 were below basic, according to the. National.

Unions claim the program is draining money from public schools, but that isn't true. Since the program began in under former. Gov. Bruce. Rauner,.

         "us-news",
         "U.S. C. Ryan. Barber 5 min. Your browser does not support. HTML5 video. Former. President. Donald. Trump was fined 10,000 on. Wednesday after being called to the witness stand in his civil-fraud trial to answer for comments he made during a break in the proceedings. NEW. YORKTrial proceedings in. Donald. Trump's civil-fraud trial took a surprise turn. Wednesday when the presiding judge summoned the former president to the witness stand to answer for comments he made in a courthouse hallwayand then fined him 10,000. The tense confrontation came during the second day of testimony ,. Trump's former lawyer and fixer who is now a lead witness for. Democratic. New. York state. Attorney. General. Letitia. James. During a break in the proceedings,. Trump in the camera-lined hallway accused the judge,. New. York. Supreme. Court. Justice. Arthur. Engoron, and the person \"sitting alongside of him\" of being partisan. Engoron took. Trump's comments as a reference to the judge's law clerk, who has sat beside him throughout the trial. On the stand,. Trump failed to persuade. Engoron otherwise. He told the judge he thought the clerk was biased, but swore under oath that he wasn't talking about her specifically in the hallway. \"To whom were you referring?\" the judge asked. \"You and. Cohen,\" said. Trump, speaking quietly. \"I find the witness is not credible,\" the judge said. New. York. Supreme. Court. Justice. Arthur. Engoron took comments the former president made as a reference to the judge's law clerk. Trump's lawyers protested the sanction. Chris. Kise, a. Trump lawyer, said the law clerk's front-and-center presence during the trial fueled. Trump's suspicions. \"Usually in my experience law clerks are not sitting right next to the judge,\". Kise said. Trump, the. Republican front-runner for the presidential nomination, previously criticized the law clerk on social media, prompting. Engoron, elected as a. Democrat, to issue a gag order that barred case participants from making public comments about his staff. Trump removed the post from the. Truth. Social platform, but the judge discovered last week that a copy of it hadn't been removed from. Trump's campaign website. Engoron fined. Trump 5,000 and warned of stiffer penalties for future violations, including possible imprisonment. Engoron on. Wednesday said he was concerned that. Trump's comments could spark violence. \"I don't want anyone killed,\" he said. Meanwhile, the. American. Civil. Liberties. Union, a frequent legal foe of the. Trump administration, took the former president's side in challenging another, limited gag order imposed in his federal prosecution in. Washington, where he faces charges that he schemed to subvert the will of. American voters to remain in power after his electoral defeat. The. ACLU, which brought more than 400 legal actions against the. Trump administration, urged. U.S. District. Judge. Tanya. Chutkan to re-evaluate the gag order she imposed last week on. Trump. The civil-liberties group, known for occasionally making strange bedfellows, argued that the restrictions on. Trump's speech were \"impermissibly broad\" and vague to the point of leaving the former president unable to \"possibly know what he is permitted to say.\" \"No modern-day president did more damage to civil liberties and civil rights than. President. Trump, but if we allow his free speech rights to be abridged, we know that other unpopular voiceseven ones we agree withwill also be silenced,\" said. Anthony. D. Romero, executive director of the. ACLU. A lawyer for. Trump,. John. Lauro, said the. ACLU's filing was \"a forceful statement of the law protecting the. First. Amendment rights of all. Americans.\". In her gag order,. Judge. Chutkan barred. Trump from making threatening comments about special counsel. Jack. Smith and his team, along with court staff and potential witnesses in the case. After. Trump initiated an appeal,. Chutkan temporarily lifted the gag order. Friday, putting it on hold while she considers a longer reprieve pending the former president's legal challenge. The. ACLU in its brief argued that the gag order's language \"effectively bars the. Defendant from addressing whole subjects of discussion\" that are sure to figure prominently in the presidential election. Limits on. Trump's speech, the. ACLU lawyers added, run the risk of undermining discussion of how the special counsel, a prominent public official, is conducting his job. The. ACLU argued that. Chutkan should \"exempt public officials from the coverage of its order, except to the extent that it bars speech that threatens or instigates violence against such persons.\". In imposing the gag order,. Chutkan pointed to evidence that when. Trump has publicly attacked individuals, \"including on matters related to this case, those individuals are consequently threatened and harassed.\". During a recent court hearing, a prosecutor on. Smith's team noted that. Chutkan herself has faced a \"criminal threat\" in connection with the casean apparent reference to a. Texas woman who was charged in. August with threatening to kill the judge. ACLU lawyers on. Wednesday said they acknowledged that.

         "Homelessness is up 60% in Alaska’s largest city, which is offering free one-way tickets to the Lower 48 states",
         "us-news",
         "Photographs for. The. Wall. Street. Journal. Oct. 25, 1000 am. ET 6 minutes. ANCHORAGE,. AlaskaEvery year around this time,. Alaska's biggest city prepares for the freezing-cold winter and deicing equipment ready. It also has to get hundreds of homeless people off the streets. The number of. Anchorage residents without homes grew nearly 60 between and to an estimated 1,760. That is more than bigger cities including. Indianapolis;. Louisville,. Ky.;. Baltimore, and. Oklahoma. City, based on point-in-time counts conducted once each year. Allowing people to stay on the streets means likely injury or death in a city that experiences an average of 20 days annually below zero degrees. Fahrenheit. But an arena used to house those without homes the past three winters was recently closed, and political infighting killed plans to build a large new shelter. Now, as part of a plan approved just a month before bitterly cold temperatures typically arrive in mid-November, aid workers are scrambling to get an estimated 700 people living outdoors into a network of hotel rooms and other makeshift facilities. Some are being offered one-way tickets to the. Lower 48 states. \"My focus is keeping people from freezing to death,\" said. Anchorage. Mayor. Dave. Bronson. Cold weather is a growing public-health threat as more people live on the streets nationwide. Nationally, about 700 homeless people a year die from exposure to the cold, according to the. National. Coalition for the. Homeless, a nonprofit group. 'My focus is keeping people from freezing to death,' says. Anchorage. Mayor. Dave. Bronson. A homeless encampment sits near downtown. Anchorage. In. Anchorage, a record 43 people have died from cold and other causes outdoors so far this year, compared with six in all of . This city of 288,000 is home to 40 of. Alaska's population of 730,000, but nearly 70 of the homeless population in this year's point-in-time count. Across the. U.S., such one-time tallies are widely acknowledged to undercount the total number of homeless people in an area. As in many states, more. Alaskans are without shelter due to rising housing costs. Average home values in. Anchorage have grown 20 since to about 377,000, according to. Zillow. But the city also faces a unique challenge native people struggling with alcohol and drug addiction or unemployment who arrive from. Alaska's many small villages in search of help. \"They lack jails and support services,\" said. Alexis. Johnson, housing and homeless coordinator for. Anchorage, where indigenous people comprise about 40 of unsheltered residents. One of the. Native. Alaskan arrivals is. Lance. Peterson, who ran away from his hometown on. Kodiak. Island as a teenager. \"The village was small, and there wasn't much to do,\" he said. Lance. Peterson, far right, at his campsite in. Davis. Park. The 25-year-old said he ended up living in a community of tents and clapboard shelters in the woods off a busy. Anchorage highway, refurbishing discarded bicycles and other goods for income. But on a blustery day in early. October, with the first snowstorm of the season looming,. Peterson was grateful for a visit from homeless advocate. Rob. Seay, who was passing out fliers advertising shelter space. \"I was wondering when they would open, thank you,\" said. Peterson, whose main source of heat is a. Duraflame log he keeps burning next to the open flap of his tent. So far this year, 19 homeless people have left. Anchorage entirely, taking one-way flights paid for government to destinations including. Dallas,. Phoenix and. Los. Angeles, as well as some. Alaskan villages. Rob. Seay, deputy director for homeless nonprofit. Henning, visited the. Davis. Park camp to hand out fliers promoting the opening of shelters. \"We ensure they are going to a location where there is a support system already in placesomeone is there to aid them with housing,\" said. Denice. Delgado, a captain with the. Salvation. Army, which administers the program. Finding a place for the rest of. Anchorage's homeless population to stay this winter has pitted local officials against each other. Until this past spring, the main emergency shelter was the. Sullivan. Arena, where a professional hockey team used to play. Converted to hold up to 500 people during the pandemic, the arena was plagued , assaults and other crime, prompting the city to close it. Many people staying there dispersed to homeless encampments around the city, including one on a vacant lot across from. Rob. Cupples's five vacation-cottage rentals. \"Anchorage is a disaster at the moment,\". Cupples said, looking at the tents and. RVs on the other side of the street. Anchorage's. Democratic-controlled assembly, its version of a city council, in authorized construction of a congregate shelter for up to 150 people, as part of a plan to rely on more dispersed facilities. Bronson, a. Republican who was elected mayor that year, pushed instead for construction of a large tent that could house up to 1,000 people temporarily. But the assembly, concerned size and cost estimates of as much as 16 million, opposed the project, leaving the two sides at a stalemate. \"When you've got a house divided, it makes it difficult to come up with a systemic plan that will deal with this,\" said. Alaska's. Republican governor,. Mike. Dunleavy. Bronson said. Anchorage has spent 161 million on homelessness over the past three years, with no permanent shelter to show for it. Instead, the. Anchorage assembly earlier this month approved an 8 million plan to shelter 374 people this winter in two hotels and another 150 in an unused city office building. Many people staying in a shelter that closed dispersed to homeless encampments around the city, including one on a vacant lot across from. Rob. Cupples's vacation-cottage rentals. Not all homeless people are willing to go indoors, though. When a group of concerned citizens went to check on. Benjamin. Abbey's camp earlier this month, he told them he probably wouldn't try to leave his elevated wooden shack this winter. \"To be honest with you,. I don't know how. I'm going to get out of here because my back is so bad,\" said. Abbey, known as \"Red.\". The 40-year-old, who has been sleeping under blankets and layers of clothing, had just one request \"A sleeping bag would be nice.\". What do you think about. Alaska's approach to its homeless population? Join the conversation below.",

Emerson grabbed two red handles, part of the system used to put out engine fires. One pilot said he grabbed. Emerson's wrist and the pilots briefly tussled with him. The other pilot declared an in-flight emergency. Had. Emerson managed to pull the handles down all the way, fuel to the plane's engines would have been cut off, turning the plane into a glider, one of the pilots told police. Alaska has said that the engines never lost power. After the brief scuffle, the pilots said. Emerson settled down and left the cockpit. He was observed walking peacefully to the back of the plane, but. Emerson told a flight attendant, \"You need to cuff me right now or it's going to be bad,\" according to court documents.

Emerson admitted to trying to disrupt the plane's operations. \"I pulled both emergency shut off handles because. I thought. I was dreaming and. I just wanna wake up,\".

Gorman to become the bank's next chief executive. Gorman, 65, has held the. CEO job for almost 14 years. A company lifer,. Pick \"bleeds blue,\" colleagues say, referring to the company's blue logo. In. Pick,. Gorman sees a fix-it man who turned around the firm's stock- and bond-trading businessesmoves that earned him a loyal following from a traditionally tough crowd. On. Thursday morning,. Pick got a standing ovation on the trading floor. \"Ted creates a phenomenal following,\". Gorman said. Some people say that he can be a hothead. He has a reputation for occasionally going off on subordinates, though friends say he has mellowed with age. After a blowup, he sometimes circles the block around the bank's offices in. Midtown. Manhattan with a colleague he has just yelled at. Employees who show even a whiff of disloyalty to the bank or to his direct reports can expect a harsh rebuke. Those who criticize his close circle of key executives can eventually find themselves out of a job, said people familiar with the matter. In softer moments, if a deputy mentions an idea that he dislikes,. Pick is known to lie on the couch in his office, look at the ceiling and say, \"Wait,. I don't understand how this would pan out.\". Longtime. Morgan. Stanley. CEO. James. Gorman says of the man picked to be his successor 'Ted creates a phenomenal following.'. In years past, deputies often avoided his office in the evening hours when they were trying to head home, walking a longer way to the elevator. Those who took the short path often found themselves beckoned come into his office to talk about the dayonly to emerge an hour or more later. Pick is the older of two siblings born to. Pablo. Pick, who ran an investment company, and. Karol. Pick, who has worked as an archivist at the. Thomas. J. Watson. Library of the. Metropolitan. Museum of. Art. Pick is now on the board of trustees of the museum. He grew up in. New. York. City and spent a few years of his childhood in. Venezuela, due to his father's job. As an undergrad at. Middlebury. College, he studied. Russian history and politics. Classmates say he was studious and not into partying. Tom. Nides, a former chief operating officer at. Morgan. Stanley, said. Pick, with his wife and two daughters, visited him earlier this year in. Israel while. Nides was the. U.S. ambassador. \"He wanted to make an effort to say, 'We are not going to. Paris or. LondonI'm going to show you this really beautiful country,'\". Nides said. \"He wants his kids exposed to the world, not just. New. York.\". Pick started at. Morgan. Stanley in as an investment-banking analyst not knowing much about finance. He later left to get an. M.B.A. at. Harvard and returned to the firm. He spent most of the next 15 years in equity capital markets, which takes companies public and manages their stock sales. Goldman. Sachs bankers started to dread hearing the name. Ted. Pick when courting potential investment banking clients, who would come back to them and say \"well. Ted said he'd give us. X.\". It forced. Goldman's bankers to up their ante, said people familiar with the matter. When he later took charge of the bank's stock-trading arm, which had been badly damaged in the financial crisis, he displayed in his office a replica of the. Titanic, which was a gift from a client,. Roberto. Mignone, founder of. Bridger. Management. \"Keeping the modesty in the middle of the congratulations\" is how. Mignone described his gift. \"He kept it in the office for years and it was enormous,\" he added. Pick also insisted on keeping in his office an armchair once used by a predecessor,. John. Havens. The chair had been in storage and. Pick had it brought out in honor of his mentor. Havens said he thought often that. Pick had what it took to be. CEO. Morgan. Stanley is in the midst of trying to settle a probe into whether bankers shared details about impending sales with favored clients before they were publicly disclosed. These days, on his coffee table, among an array of books, is former. CEO. John. Mack's memoir. In the depths of the financial crisis,. Pick regularly rode the elevator up to the 40th floor to update. Mack on how the bank's shares were doing. Pick said his promotion represents a change in leadership but not a change in strategy. \"This is about keeping going a great thing,\" he said. Gorman, on the other hand, took the approach of turning things inside out when he became. CEO in . He wanted the bank to be more stable than the typical. Wall. Street roller coaster. So he doubled down on the steadier business of wealth management. It now makes up about half of the bank's total revenue, helping to smooth the ups and downs of trading and investment banking. Still, tougher times could be ahead. The bank just reported third-quarter results that included a sharp drop in investment-banking revenue, falling short of results at rivals. Net new assets in wealth management slowed substantially, rattling some shareholders. And higher-for-longer interest rates are putting pressure on deal making and wealth management across the industry. A blemish on. Pick's record that is yet to be resolved is. Morgan. Stanley's role in a block-trading scandal. The bank is in the midst of trying to settle a probe into whether bankers shared details about impending sales with favored clients before they were publicly disclosed.

         "Agreement gives workers a 25% raise over the course of the contract, puts pressure on its Detroit rivals",
         "business",
         "9 min. UAW members picket outside. Ford's. Kentucky truck plant in. Louisville this month. Here's what to know about the deal, what's next for. Ford and the union, and what the agreement means for the company as well as its rivals. General. Motors. GM -0.29 . What is in the new tentative agreement for workers? If approved, the deal would raise workers' wages by 25 over the life of the 4-year contract, boosting the top pay to 40 an hour. Currently, assembly line workers max out at about 32 an hour. Members would receive 11 of that increase upon ratification. The new contract would also shorten the time it takes for production workers to hit that top pay level, reducing it to three years from eight under the agreement that expired in. September. Ford members are also expected to receive cost-of-living adjustments to protect wages against inflation, a benefit that was suspended in . Temporary workers will see significant raises of more than 150 over the life of the contract. While union officials didn't disclose an exact figure. Wednesday,. Ford had previously offered these workers a wage of about 21 an hour, a jump from the around 17 earned originally. UAW-represented retirees would also enjoy improved benefits if the deal is ratified, including more for pensions and 401ks. As. UAW workers fight for job security amid the industry's shift to electric vehicles, the union also secured a key victory at. Ford the right to strike over plant closures. This is the first time in. UAW history it has had such a right, union leaders said. Wednesday. The. UAW scored one of its biggest bargaining victories in decades, winning an extremely lucrative deal for its. Ford workers, and after weeks of company executives saying they need to keep labor costs in check to remain competitive. On wages,. Ford had originally offered a 9 increase over four yearsversus the union's 40 demandand had hoped to hold off on other items, such as the return of cost-of-living raises. Play video. Ford. Reaches. Tentative. Labor. Deal. With. UAW. The. United. Auto. Workers union said it reached a new tentative deal with. Ford that could bring an end to a six-week strike at one automaker while negotiations continue at. General. Motors and. Chrysler-parent. Stellantis. Recently during negotiations,. Ford executives made a point of saying publicly that the company had hit its limit in what it could offer in economic concessions, only to slightly increase their offer further. Chief. Executive. Jim. Farley has also described some of their earlier offers as record proposals, and still came up more in the final pact. The. UAW, meanwhile, ratcheted up the pressure on company bargainers, first striking factories in. Illinois and. Michigan and later walking off the job at its massive plant in. Kentucky. This week, it threatened to hit one of its biggest moneymakersthe. F-150 pickup-truck factory near its headquarters in. Dearborn,. Mich.which further prodded. Ford into reaching a deal. Still, it doesn't appear the union got everything it wanted, such as a shorter, four-day workweek for full 40-hour pay or defined benefit pensions for all workers. The full details of the contract aren't out yet, so members will have a better idea of what exactly they won when those are available. How much will this cost. Ford? The contract would leave. Ford with higher labor costs than executives expected going into the talks, and widen the disparity between nonunionized rivals such as. Toyota and. Tesla. Ford. Executive. Chair. Bill. Ford said last week that the union's demands could hurt the company's competitiveness and curb future. U.S. factory investment. Ford. Executive. Chair. Bill. Ford said last week that the union's demands could hurt the automaker's competitiveness. The contract will add about 1.5 billion to. Ford's annual labor costs, equal to roughly 13 of its global operating profit based on the company's most recent earnings guidance, according to. J.P. Morgan. Ford's per-hour labor cost, including benefits, would be around 67 this year and rise to about 88 full year of the contract, in , according to. Wells. Fargo. That is significantly higher than the labor costs of the foreign automakers, estimated in the mid-50s per hour, and. Tesla at 45 to 50. Those companies could face wage inflation in coming years, though, partly as a result of. UAW's richer contracts. Union leaders already have vowed to organize nonunion factories. The six-week strike hit. Ford's bottom line by about 1.3 billion, the company said. Thursday, with nearly all of that hit coming in the fourth quarter. Work stoppages at three plants resulted in lost production of about 77,000 vehicles, including around 25,000 highly profitable large pickup trucks and. SUVs from. Ford's. Louisville,. Ky., factory, according to a. Deutsche. Bank estimate. First, the. UAW's. Ford council, which comprises elected union leaders, will convene in. Detroit to review the tentative agreement and need to approve it before moving it along to the members. The gathering should occur in the next several days. If the council approves, the union plans to hold a livestream to review the specifics of the agreement publicly and publish both a contract summary and the full agreement online. Striking members will also receive instructions on returning to work. Over the next week, leaders at the union's locals across the country will walk members through the details and hold ratification votes. UAW. President. Shawn. Fain, center, visited striking union workers outside a. Chicago. Ford assembly center earlier this month. A majority of members need to approve the contract in order for it to be adopted. There have been times in the past, including at. Ford, where the results came close and only a slight majority approved the contract. Many industry observers are worried that. UAW. President. Shawn. Fain has set expectations too high for workers, making it tougher to win their support for the first deal. How will this deal impact. GM and. Stellantis? GM and. Stellantis face pressure to quickly seal their own tentative contracts. The union's decision to halt the strike at. Ford factories before members vote on the proposed contract should serve as an added incentive for. GM and. Stellantis to settle their negotiations. Workers remain on strike at two. Stellantis factories and three. GM plants. Historically, the. UAW and. Detroit automakers a pattern-bargaining process. Once one company gets a contract, the other two agree to roughly the same terms. It is unclear if that pattern will hold. However,. GM and. Stellantis already had offers on the table that weren't far off the terms in. Ford's tentative agreement, a sign the two companies could reach deals relatively soon. As of last week, both. GM and. Stellantis were offering 23 wage increases, just short of the 25 in. Ford's agreement. But the companies' proposals lagged behind. Ford in some areas. Neither had gone as far as. Ford on cost-of-living adjustments or providing a shorter path to top pay for new hires,. Fain said last week. There are also company-specific issues at the other two that are unique to their talks, such as. Stellantis's idling of a 1,350-employee plant in. Illinois that made. Jeeps. What does this mean for the. UAW and. U.S. labor movement more broadly? The. UAW has made clear that it has a broader mission in mind here. The talks with the. Detroit automakers aren't only about winning gains for auto factory workers but about setting a bar for what can be achieved for middle-class workers more broadly. Fain has also talked about organizing other automakers, like. Tesla, that don't have unionized workforces, and a major win in. Detroit could help give the. UAW leverage in those efforts. \"Together, we are turning the tide for the working class in this country,\". Fain said in a video address. Wednesday night. The. U.S. labor movement has in recent years been reinvigorated to advance their pay and benefits, after a bruising few years working through the pandemic and amid a broader worker shortage. Unions in other industries, including package delivery and airlines, have also notched major victories, and the. UAW's gains in. Detroit will add to this momentum. Bags of. Cash. From. Drug. Cartels.

         "New. Speaker. Mike. Johnson's. To-Do. List. A. Looming. Funding. Deadline and. Israel,. Ukraine. Aid. With just over three weeks until a potential government shutdown,. Johnson takes over. GOP negotiating duties with. Democrats 950 7 min 013. House. Republicans elected. Rep. Mike. Johnson of. Louisiana as speaker of the. House on. Wednesday, more than three weeks after. Kevin. McCarthy was ousted. WASHINGTONThe. House is back open for business. But getting legislation through itmuch less agreeing with the. Democratic. Senate and. President. Bidenwon't be easy for brand-new. Speaker of the. House. Mike. Johnson, with major deadlines less than a month away. After 22 days of. GOP infighting, the. Louisiana. Republican secured his post. Wednesday without any opposition from his fellow. House. Republicans. That unity will be tested soon, with lawmakers facing a slew of policy and political challenges, including a government funding deadline in three weeks, aid requests for. Israel and. Ukraine and a farm bill that has already expired. It will mark the first time that. Johnson, who until recently was the vice chair of the. House. Republican conference, will be the top negotiator with. Democrats on behalf of a group of. Republicans still divided over both ideology and political tactics. After weeks of. GOP infighting,. Rep. Mike. Johnson of. Louisiana was voted the new. House speaker. \"In terms of being able to effectively legislate in divided governmentthat part of this job is going to make getting elected speaker look kind of easy,\" said. Rep. Steve. Womack. R.,. Ark., a longtime member of the. House. Appropriations. Committee, which writes spending bills. Johnson met with. President. Biden in the. Situation. Room at the. White. House on. Thursday, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, and attended a briefing with administration officials and other top lawmakers about the president's foreign-aid and border request. The meeting at the. White. House included congressional leadership of both parties, and key committee chairs and ranking members. Later,. Johnson also met with. Senate. Minority. Leader. Mitch. McConnell. R.,. Ky.. The most immediate deadline facing. Johnson is the expiration of the government's current funding on. Nov. 17. In a letter sent to. House. Republicans earlier this week,. Johnson mapped out a timeline for immediately bringing the. GOP-crafted spending bills that haven't yet passed the. House up for votes. But because the. House will need to reach an agreement with the. Senate and. White. Housewidely seen as infeasible for all 12 bills within the next three weeksJohnson said. House. Republicans may need to buy themselves more time by passing a stopgap spending measure that would continue current funding levels either into mid-January or mid-April, depending on. Republicans' preference. The goal would be to eliminate the year-end pressure that often compels. Congress to pass a massive spending package in a rush before. Christmas. \"We all understand that our next. Speaker must be prepared to negotiate from a position of strength with the. Democrat-controlled. Senate and. White. House,\". Johnson wrote in the letter. Such stopgap measures have been fiercely opposed right flank of the. House. GOP conference, fueling some of the anger toward former. House. Speaker. Kevin. McCarthy. R.,. Calif., who was ousted earlier this month after passing the most recent short-term spending patch to avert a government shutdown. The. House passed a resolution affirming support for. Israel on. Wednesday. Many lawmakers believe. Johnson will have a little more leeway next month with conservatives who celebrated his ascension to power this week. Rep. Chip. Roy. R.,. Texas said he would be open to a short-term spending patch in service of a longer-term goal of reducing federal spending. \"It just depends on how it's structured, framed and whether it's tactical,\" he told reporters. While some lawmakers held out hope they would be able to pass and negotiate individual spending bills before the mid-November deadline, others acknowledged that was likely unrealistic. \"If you think somehow we're going to be able to wrap everything up in three weeks-ish, yeehaw. God bless you,\" said. Rep. Mark. Amodei. R.,. Nev. \"If you really want to act like the majority over here, part of that is calendar realities.\". Democrats said that so far, the individual spending bills passed with. GOP support in the. House aren't getting them closer to a viable bipartisan compromise. \"There's a view that we can do these individual bills the way we were doing before this chaosI think that's futile,\" said. Rep. Rosa. DeLauro of. Connecticut, the top. Democrat on the. House. Appropriations. Committee. DeLauro said there wasn't enough time to deliberate on each individual bill. \"That ship sailed, my friend.\". Some. Republicans are skeptical of new funding for. Ukraine, and may push to pair it with tighter border security and immigration policy changes. One unusual dynamic that could complicate spending negotiations is a provision included as part of last summer's debt limit deal that says if the government is being funded by a stopgap spending measure on. Jan. 1, automatic across-the-board cuts known as a sequester would kick in, hitting the military hard. The provision would cut current spending by 1 beginning in. April . Johnson will also have to contend with complicated intraparty dynamics in navigating the. Biden administration's request for 106 billion in emergency funds for. Ukraine,. Israel,. Taiwan and the. U.S. border. There is broad bipartisan support in. Congress for aid to. Israel, following the deadly attacks this month. The first measure. Johnson brought to the. House floor. Wednesday was a resolution affirming support for. Israel and condemning. Hamas that passed 412-10. But some. Republicans are skeptical of new funding for. Ukraine, and. Johnson said. Thursday night on. Fox. News that he would bring a stand-alone bill funding. Israel but not. Kyiv to the floor. He said that the consensus among. House. Republicans is to separate the two aid packages, while adding that lawmakers are \"not going to abandon\". Ukraine. Johnson, like many. Republicans, voted against 300 million in security assistance to. Ukraine in. September. \"I believe that he will get to. Ukraine aid, but it's going to come at some hard negotiating,\" said. Rep. Don. Bacon. R.,. Neb. \"The president's going to have to make his case.\". The. White. House separately requested on. Wednesday additional funding, including 23.5 billion in disaster relief for the. Maui wildfires, floods in. California and. Vermont and other natural disasters. How do you think. Mike. Johnson will handle the challenges facing. Congress? Join the conversation below. The five-year farm bill, meanwhile, lapsed at the end of. September. Johnson in his letter said he hoped to pass the farm bill in. December and begin negotiations with the. Senate as soon as possible. House. Agriculture. Committee. Chairman. Glenn. Thompson. R.,. Pa. said he hoped to pass the next full five-year bill then. Many other lawmakers expect. Congress will have to pass an extension of current farm bill programs while they hash out both internal disagreements over spending levels and partisan fights over contentious programs like food assistance. A budget blueprint from the time when. Johnson chaired the. Republican. Study. Committee, which represents a spectrum of. House conservatives, proposed saving billions on programs designed to help support farmers who grow major commodities. \"Agriculture is very important in. Republican districts,\" said. Rep. Frank. Lucas. R.,. Okla., a former. House. Agriculture. Committee. Chairman, noting he was confident. Johnson would take a different approach now. \"It's one thing to be the leader of a particular niche group here in. Congress. It's another thing to be a leader of the. United. States. House.\".

         "How. Patrick. McHenry. Kept. House. Running. After. GOP's 'Political. Suicide' 5 min. Rep. Patrick. McHenry, in bow tie, handed over the gavel to. Mike. Johnson after he won the vote to become. House speaker on. Wednesday. WASHINGTONA little more than three weeks after he took the gavel as speaker pro tempore and a day after he handed it back,. Rep. Patrick. McHenry was ready to tell his story. McHenry told reporters. Thursday that the ouster of. Kevin. McCarthy. R.,. Calif. as speaker and the dysfunction it sparked were \"well outside the normative bounds of this institution. That is a nice way to say itor perhaps the dumbest set of politics for decision-making a majority party in this institution could make.\". The. North. Carolina. Republican also explained why he rebuffed calls to exert more power in his unprecedented role, despite calls from some allies, and why he resisted an effort to hold a vote to give him additional temporary authority. And yes, he said, he was indeed really angry when he banged the gavel to adjourn the. House in his initial minutes on the job. The comments marked his first reflections on the party drama and his brief tenure after stepping down from his post following. Wednesday's election of new. House. Speaker. Mike. Johnson. R.,. La.. As speaker pro tempore,. McHenry focused on the narrow job of running the. House until it could elect a new head, as. Republicans struggled to unite behind a standard-bearer, and kept his public remarks to a minimum. NEWSLETTER. SIGN-UP. Get email notifications about major political news, from campaigns to the. Capitol. McHenry, who had left party leadership in favor of chairing the. House. Financial. Services. Committee, told reporters he had time to prepare for the job, but not much. He said he was informed two weeks before. McCarthy was ousted as speaker that he was the top name on a secret list prepared -speaker to ensure continuity in government. At the time, he said, the two didn't discuss the parameters of his possible role as speaker pro tempore, in part because he didn't expect. McCarthy would be ousted, or that the interregnum until the next speaker would last as long as it did. \"The role was conceived of as a continuity-of-government issue, post mass casualties. It was not conceived of that a majority party in the. Congress would commit political suicide on the floor and then not be able to put things back together,\". McHenry said. When. McHenry was installed on. Oct. 3, he quickly adjourned the. House with a bang of the gavel so hard that clips of it went viral online. What was behind that slam? \"Pure anger,\" he said, over \"the circumstance we're in\" at the time. \"Look,. Kevin duct-taped the conference together pretty well for 10 months,\" he said. \"The last three weeks made it look easy in comparison.\". Rep. Patrick. McHenry of. North. Carolina, acting as. Speaker pro tempore, slammed the gavel. Tuesday, after the. House of. Representatives voted to remove. Rep. Kevin. McCarthy as speaker. McHenry had to abruptly adjust to living the life of a. House speaker without having sought the job. He suddenly had a security detail that drove himand his three children. In his 22 days in the post,. McHenry said he was under pressure from lawmakers to take a more expansive view of his authority and bring legislation to the floor, with members unable to elect a new speaker but exasperated and eager to get back to work. But after consulting with the. House's nonpartisan parliamentarian and doing his own research,. McHenry said he came to the decision that he simply wouldn't. \"I came to the firm conclusion that my role was only to preside over the election of the speaker. You had to force the big decision and not try to get around it means,\" he said. If some lawmakers had tried to pressure him to bring legislation to the floor and potentially overrule an objection from the parliamentarian,. McHenry told them he would resign from the post. \"I think we're at a bigger moment in our politics where our institutions have been undermined in significant ways, and. I don't want to participate in any further undermining of our institutional order or constitutional framework,\" he said. In particular,. McHenry knew. McCarthy had a different view of what powers his temporary replacement had. McCarthy told reporters he thought. McHenry's role, conceived after the. Sept. 11, , attacks, gave him broad latitude, including to bring legislation to the floor. \"Kevin's a dear friend of mine and we have two different views of my role and the actions. I could have taken and that's. OK,\". McHenry said. \"But. I've got to answer for my actions.\". McHenry said he viewed differently the efforts colleagues to elect him as speaker pro tempore on the. House floora move that he said was in line with past actions. But because some. Republicans opposed that effort, it likely would have required support fromand concessions toDemocrats. Procedurally, \"there's nothing questionable about it,\" he said. \"But. I wanted it to be the will of the. House. Republican conference on who our speaker is, not do an end-run around it.\". On. Wednesday, during what was otherwise a rowdy, partisan atmosphere during. Johnson's election,. McHenry received a standing ovation from both sides of the aisle as he prepared to hand over the gavel. \"I notice a little bit more of a smile on your face today than we have in the past,\". House.

         "business",
         "U.S. Trade. Loophole. Fuels. Rise of. China's. New. E-Commerce. Firms. Discount retailers. Shein and. Temu attract. American shoppers at a rapid clip while shipping tax-free with little customs scrutiny , 24 7 min. The bargain shopping app of. Shein, which also hosts bricks-and-mortar pop-ups, is raising concerns in the. U.S. A law that allows low-price packages to enter the. U.S. duty-free and with little customs scrutiny has enabled the breakneck growth of two e-commerce companies with roots in. China. Shein and. Temu. Packages valued under 800 can enter the. U.S. under simplified procedures known as the de minimis exemption. Lawmakers and some. U.S. businesses say it is a loophole that the. Chinese companies are using at a huge scale, allowing shipments of products that are unsafe or made with forced labor, while avoiding taxes. 1Q 1Q '22 1Q '23 0 10 20 30 40 50 60. A record of more than one billion packages entered the. U.S. in the fiscal year ended. Sept. 30 under the de minimis exemptiontwice the level, according to an estimate by. U.S. Customs and. Border. Protection. A separate congressional study concluded that. Shein and. Temu alone account for about one in three of those packages. The two bargain apps have lured tens of millions of. American consumers with 4. T-shirts, 10 hair dryers and other products. \"De minimis is the world's greatest black market and astonishingly legalized by the. U.S. government,\" said. Kim. Glas, head of the. National. Council of. Textile. Organizations, a. U.S. trade group. \"It's a wildfire out of control.\". Shein's and. Temu's bargain shopping apps are putting pressure on. U.S. companies including. Gap,. Amazon and. Walmart. Amazon has seen traffic on its website decline, and a. Gap executive acknowledged in an. August earnings call that. Shein was gaining market . A spokeswoman for. Amazon said the company continues to see growth online and with its app. Shein's monthly active. U.S. users more than doubled to 30.2 million in the third quarter of from , according to. Sensor. Tower, a market-intelligence provider. Temu grew even faster, surpassing. Shein's total users within a year of its launch to become one of the top-downloaded shopping apps in the. U.S. The companies ship most of their products directly from. China to individual. American customers. Nearly all the orders fall below the 800 de minimis threshold, meaning they generally aren't subject to tariffs or inspected at the border. The average order value on. Shein was 71 in. May, according to the. Hong. Kong-based data provider. Measurable. AI. Temu has grown so swiftly that it surpassed. Shein's total users within a year of its launch to become one of the top-downloaded shopping apps in the. U.S. Both companies said that they comply with trade laws and that their growth isn't dependent on the de minimis policy. And they both attributed their success to their supply-chain proficiency. The de minimis provision dates to the. Tariff. Act of . Congress wanted to exempt. American tourists from paying taxes on small purchases when they returned from trips abroad. In , just as e-commerce was taking off, lawmakers raised the threshold for exempt packages to 800, from 200, with the goal of reducing customs officials' workload. U.S. Customs and. Border. Protection hasn't updated regulations in response to the surge, despite concluding in a report last year that the overwhelming volume of low-price packages created an \"unacceptable risk\" of allowing imports of unsafe products. A. CBP official said that tightening regulations on such shipments is the \"top priority\" for the agency, adding it plans to propose a new regulation to require more data on each package within the next few months. While. Shein and. Temu aren't the only retailers that take advantage of the exemption, their rapid growth has occurred during a period of rising tensions between. Washington and. Beijing. In. April, the. U.S.-China. Economic and. Security. Review. Commission, a government agency that makes policy recommendations to. Congress, criticized. Shein's business practices, citing potential health hazards stemming from harmful chemicals in its products, waste and pollution caused -volume production, and dozens of claims of copyright infringements. The commission's members include. Glas, the. U.S. textile-industry representative. How should lawmakers close the loophole in the. U.S. trade law and restrain e-commerce discounters. Shein and. Temu? Join the conversation below. The companies also face allegations that forced labor has been used to produce the cheap goods they sell. Lawmakers and state attorneys general have pressed. Shein to respond to allegations that it sources cotton from. China's. Xinjiang region, where the. U.S. has accused. Chinese authorities of committing genocide and of using forced labor in its repression of mostly. Muslim. Uyghursallegations that. Beijing denies. U.S. law that went into force in. June largely bans the import of goods tied to that region. Shein said the company has \"zero tolerance\" for forced labor. Temu said the allegations are \"completely ungrounded.\". The company doesn't have a team in the. U.S. to liaise with regulators and legislators, but \"our commitment to full compliance has been unwavering since our inception and underpins all of our business activities,\" said a. Temu spokesperson. Rep. Earl. Blumenauer, an. Oregon. Democrat, has proposed bipartisan legislation that would deny de minimis treatment to all goods from. China, saying the exemption \"has developed into a huge loophole that undercuts. American competitiveness.\". The. Senate has similar outstanding bills. \"We should just eliminate the exemption entirely,\" said. Rep. Mike. Gallagher, a. Wisconsin. Republican who chairs the. House. Select. Committee on the. Chinese. Communist. Party, the panel that wrote the study about the companies. Efforts to close the de minimis provision face pushback from some. Republican lawmakers with traditional pro-free-trade views as well as. American businesses that are delivering the additional packages, particularly. UPS and. FedEx. \"De minimis is not a loophole, it is a fixture of. U.S. customs law that. Congress intentionally passed to lower costs for consumers and improve supply chains for. American small businesses,\" said. John. Pickel, a senior director at the. National. Foreign. Trade. Council, a business advocacy group whose members include. UPS and. FedEx. He said restricting the use of the de minimis threshold would end up overwhelming customs officials' ability to process cargo, causing delays for consumers and businesses. Shein has ramped up its lobbying efforts, spending 600,000 on federal lobbying during the second quarter this year, more than double the amount in the first quarter. In. July, a. Shein executive wrote to fellow apparel makers saying it would support changing the de minimis policy, as long as the law applied equally to all retailers. Temu also said it is open to policy changes. Bags of. Cash. From. Drug. Cartels. Flood. Teller. Windows at. U.S. Banks. European. Navies. Leave the. U.S. High and. Dry. Welcome to the.

In both cases, governments intervened to keep the problems from spreading. NEWSLETTER. SIGN-UP. Get email notifications when major financial-market and trading news breaks. Historically, big lurches in monetary policy increase the chances of something going haywire in financial markets. A study published in. May of rate increases for 17 developed countries over 150 years concluded that \"monetary policy rate hikes that were preceded by a series of cuts or a long period of low rates materially increase crisis risk.\". The \"U-shaped monetary rate path,\" as a senior researcher from the. Bank of. Spain and three co-authors called it, \"increases banking crisis risk, via credit and asset price cycles.\". Sometimes the cause-and-effect linkages between rising rates and financial blowups are clear-cut. Other times they are more muddled. Credit losses, liquidity crunches and high leverage often play crucial rules, with no way to cleanly isolate the effects of different factors. The. Federal. Reserve's interest-rate hikes to combat inflation during the late s and early s rendered much of the. U.S. savings-and-loan industry insolvent. The federal government set the rates that thrifts were allowed to pay on deposits, and many customers pulled their money to seek higher returns elsewhere. At the same time,. SLs mainly made long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. The market values of those assets plunged as rates soared. A similar scenario happened at. First. Republic. Bank and. Silicon. Valley. Bank, which collapsed this year. Regulators let zombie thrifts persist for years, and their financial condition got worse. s, more than 1,000 thrifts failed, and.

The bank had grown rapidly, making risky loans at below-market rates even while interest rates were soaring. A. Chicago competitor in told. The. Wall. Street. Journal, \"Even with a 20 prime they were doing 16 fixed-rate loans. I don't know how they do it.\". Banking regulators ultimately provided several billion dollars of assistance and guaranteed all depositors and creditors, leading. Continental.

Margin calls ensued, and the computerized trading systems of that era couldn't handle the transaction volumes. But interest rates and currency markets were crucial drivers. The dollar had been weakening against the. West. German mark, while the 30-year. Treasury yield rocketed past 10 from 7.5 in. March. When rates go higher, stocks often decline because companies' future earnings are worth less. Stocks kept going up anyway that summer, setting the stage for a swift fall. The.

Rates fell to 1 by , setting the stage for nearly two decades of mostly low rates. Here, the. Fed more often is blamed for leaving rates too low for too long than for raising them too high. It increased rates 17 times from. June to. June , in each instance by a quarter-point. Signs of a housing downturn were surfacing when it stopped. By , the start of the financial crisis was under way, and the. Fed resumed rate cuts again later that year. Do you think higher rates could cause another financial crisis? Join the conversation below. For millions of. Americans, the impact of higher interest rates hit home directly, because they had taken on adjustable-rate mortgages that reset higher after their rock-bottom introductory rates expired. Often the customers could afford to pay only the initial teaser rates, while the lenders didn't care because they quickly had sold off the loans to investors in bundles backing complex mortgage bonds. The ensuing credit losses might have been more about lax underwriting standards than rising rates. But the higher rates when the loans reset contributed to record numbers of foreclosures, nonetheless. President. George. W. Bush spoke at the. White. House in alongside from left to right,. Fed.

         "The Third Quarter GDP Boom",
         "Consumers keep driving the economy even as business investment lags.",
         "opinion",
         "REVIEW. OUTLOOK. Consumers keep driving the economy even as business investment lags. 554 3 min. The. U.S. economy keeps on growing, and in the third quarter it positively boomed. This is good news , though it's striking how few economists think it can keep going. Let's hope they keep being wrong. Gross domestic product grew 4.9 after inflation in the third quarter on an annual basis. The doughty. American consumer led the way, with personal consumption growing 4 and contributing about 2.7 percentage points to overall growth. OPINION. POTOMAC. WATCH 2025 1x. Few predicted this when the. Federal. Reserve began raising short-term interest rates at an unprecedented pace in spring . Healthy job growth means consumers still have money to spend, and the wealth effect from this year's rising stock market helps to buoy consumer sentiment. Perhaps some consumers are also still spending down their pandemic-era savings and transfer payments. Also good news was the third-quarter inflation data. The. Fed's preferred index of personal-consumption-expenditure inflation, excluding food and energy, fell to 2.4 for the quarter. That's down from 3.7 in the second quarter, and this is the first time it's been below 3 since the end of . The question is whether this economic levitation act can keep going. One warning sign for the future was the decline in the savings rate to a lowly 3.8. That plus rising auto-loan defaults suggests consumers may have less running room over the next year. Another caution signal was nearly flat fixed business investment, especially for equipment. Most of the increase in private investment came from the buildup in inventories, which can't continue without sales. Future investment will also have to overcome the recent surge in long-term interest rates, with the 10-year. Treasury yield now hovering near 5. These rates aren't high , and they should lead to better investment choices. But they will have a dampening effect as businesses adjust to the new rate reality. Some business investment also comes from government subsidies for climate-related industries that may or may not turn out to be economic. This provides a short-term lift to. GDP, but subsidies pay off only if they yield new technologies or applications that can be profitable once the gravy train ends. The. Biden. Administration's campaign to raise energy prices across the economy in the name of climate change will also weigh on future growth. None of these caveats means we shouldn't celebrate the. American economy's resilience, which really is a wonder given the obstacles piled onto it class. But the history of periods with rising interest rates is that the economy keeps growing until it doesn't. The transition can be fast. If this era defies that precedent, as it has so far, we will deserve to be called the lucky country. Journal. Editorial. Report. The week's best and worst from. Dan. Henninger,. Mary. O'Grady and.

         "REVIEW. OUTLOOK. The real test of the deal will be whether. Ford can stay competitive. 777 3 min. Members of the. United. Auto. Workers. UAW pickett outside of the. Michigan. Parts. Assembly. Plant in. Wayne,. Mich.,. Sept. 26. President. Biden praised what he called the \"historic tentative agreement\" that the. United. Auto. Workers and. Ford struck late. Wednesday as a testament to collective bargaining. Perhaps, but the real test will be whether. Ford can stay competitive, especially amid the government-forced electric-vehicle transition. OPINION. POTOMAC. WATCH 2219 1x. UAW. President. Shawn. Fain's strategy of staging strikes at select plants operated. Detroit auto makers appears to be paying off. The union was threatening to call off workers at a factory that builds. Ford's highly profitable. F-150 pickup when the auto maker agreed to a generous deal that ends the nearly six-week walkout. Ford agreed to raise wages 25 over four years and restore cost-of-living adjustmentsa major improvement on its initial 15 offer. Ford's top pay rate will increase 30 to more than 40 an hour. The starting wage will rise 68 to more than 28 an hour, which is more than a typical college grad makes straight out of school. Ford's initial offer eliminated lower wages for newer hiresimplemented when the. Big. Three auto makers verged on collapse in but the union also won a faster progression to top pay. The union says members will receive more in general wage increases over the next four-and-a-half years than they have over the last 22 years combined. Some of the deal's details remain murky, but the. UAW says \"workers with pensions also will see increases for when they retire, and those hired after with 401k plans will get large increases.\". The. UAW also claims it has won the right to strike if. Ford decides to close a plant, which could give the union more leverage to extract more concessions down the line. Ford appears to have made the calculation that the high price is worth labor peace. That's how collective bargaining works, and investors can decide if the deal is worth it. That may take a while to become clear, as. Ford has to pump more capital into producing money-losing. EVs that governments are mandating. Ford this summer said it expected to lose 4.5 billion this year on. EVs, though it could be more since last week it recalled 35,000. Mustang. Mach-Es because of a manufacturing defect. The. UAW deal will cost. Ford an estimated 900 million in the first year and could make it harder to stay competitive with foreign auto makers and. Tesla. Perhaps. Ford will rely on employee attrition and automation to hold down costs. Automation has helped make. Tesla profitable, and more of it is inevitable. UAW members will be the long-term losers if. Wednesday's deal causes their jobs to vanish. Bags of. Cash. From. Drug. Cartels. Flood. Teller. Windows at. U.S. Banks. European. Navies. Leave the. U.S. High and. Dry. Welcome to the.

         "opinion",
         "REVIEW. OUTLOOK. How officials snooped on staffers investigating. Justice's press leaks and investigations. Oct. 26, 641 pm. ET 4 min. The. Justice. Department's. Crossfire. Hurricane investigation is the fiasco that keeps on giving, and look no further than this week's revelations of abuse of power. The latest news is that. Justice snooped on the. Congressional investigators who dared to conduct oversight of its snooping on the. Trump campaign. Numerous current and former congressional staffers have learned that. Justice subpoenaed their personal phone and email records in , likely under the pretext of a leak investigation. The targets included. Republican and. Democratic staffers in the. Senate and. House. They join staffers and. Members of the. House. Intelligence. Committee, who over the past two years said they were notified. Apple that. Justice seized their data. , executive-branch prosecutors have now been caught fishing through the records of more than a dozen employees of the congressional branch. DOJ's inspector general is probing the matter. OPINION. POTOMAC. WATCH 2025 1x. Last week. Google notified. Jason. Foster,. Sen. Chuck. Grassley's former chief investigative counsel on the. Judiciary. Committee, that. Justice sought and received. Mr. Foster's personal records. In a subsequent. Freedom of. Information. Act request to. Justice,. Mr. Foster's nonprofit,. Empower. Oversight, lays out the scope of. Justice's search. The. FOIA letter to. Justice says. Google received a federal subpoena on. Sept. 12, , for records related to a. Foster family telephone number, as well as other accounts that are redacted but that. Empower. Oversight believes belonged to other staffers. \"For each of the listed telephone and email accounts, the subpoena compelled. Google to release customer or subscriber information, as well as subscribers' names, addresses, local and long distance telephone connection records, message logs, records of session times and durations, length of service and types of service utilized for the period from. December 1, to. May 1, ,\" says the letter. DOJ wanted to know. Mr. Foster's sources and methods. Recall what was going on at that time. The. Washington. Post in reported on a wiretapped phone call between incoming. Trump national security adviser. Michael. Flynn and. Russian ambassador. Sergei. Kislyakan egregious leak of classified information. The. Senate. Judiciary. Committee sought answers from. DOJ about the. Flynn probe and the leak. DOJ provided few answers to. Congress, though in an effort to justify its snooping it revealed that it also had a surveillance warrant against former. Trump aide. Carter. Page. Details of that classified. Page warrant soon leaked to the press, via stories that sought to bolster the. FBI's narrative of. Trump-Russia collusion. At the time. DOJ was essentially run , after then. Attorney. General. Jeff. Sessions recused himself from. Trump-Russia questions, while former. FBI. Director. James. Comey had been fired that. May. Was. DOJ conducting an investigation into the. Flynn and. Page classified leaks? The subpoena's dates for. Mr. Foster's records match up. But then why subpoena. Congress? Only executive-branch officials would have initially had details of the. Flynn conversation. As the. FOIA letter notes, the subpoena raises \"the question of whether the. Department also subpoenaed the personal phone and email records of every. Executive. Branch official who had access to the same information. If not, then the entire exercise looks more like a pretext to gather intelligence on those conducting oversight of the. Department rather than a legitimate classified leak inquiry.\". The. Foster subpoena sought a family phone number, one that. Empower notes was \"actually used , who never communicated with the media on that phone number or any other.\". Mr. Foster was an attorney advising a congressional committee conducting oversight. The subpoenas ignored attorney-client privilege, the. Constitution's. Speech or. Debate. Clause that protects. Members in their official duties, and the separation of powers. All of this is further evidence of how officials at the. Justice. Department lost their bearings over. Donald. Trump and in the process exceeded their proper authority. Congress deserves a full explanation of who authorized these subpoenas, why they were issued, and what protections will guarantee it won't happen again. The. House. Oversight. Committee wants to see more than 5,000 emails. Vice. President. Biden sent using a pseudonym, while a third bank memorandum details further allegations of payments to the.

         "Warren says jump on short-selling, Gary Gensler says how high?",
         "opinion",
         "REVIEW. OUTLOOK. Oct. 26, 636 pm. ET 99 5 min. Securities and. Exchange. Commission. Chair. Gary. Gensler. After the meme stock craze in early , progressives accused hedge funds of market manipulation. Although the agency didn't find evidence of illegal conduct,. Chair. Gary. Gensler is following. Sen. Elizabeth. Warren's orders regulations that will increase the cost of investing and, ironically, the risk of market manipulation. OPINION. POTOMAC. WATCH 2025 1x. The. SEC this month finalized a rule that will require institutional investment managers to report granular information about their short stock positions. \"Given past market events, it's important for the. Commission and the public to know more about short sale activity in the equity markets, especially in times of stress or volatility,\". Mr. Gensler said. Broker-dealers are required already to report some information about short positions to their self-regulatory body, the. Financial. Industry. Regulatory. Authority. The. SEC rule would cover a broader universe of investment managers, including hedge funds, banks, pension funds and insurance companies. Managers with a short position of at least 10 million or the equivalent of 2.5 or more of a company's outstanding shares would have to disclose daily changes in their positions. The. SEC would publish the data in aggregate each month. The rule says regulators currently can't \"distinguish the type of trader engaged in short selling or identify individual short positions, as well as the fluctuation in those positions,\" which handicapped the. SEC investigation of the meme stock rally. In other words, if only the. SEC had access to more data, it might have found illicit activity. That's questionable. But it's almost certain that the rule's harm will exceed its benefits. The rule itself admits it \"may harm price efficiency cost of short selling\" compliance burdens, potentially revealing short sellers' trading strategies, and \"increasing the threat of retaliation against. Managers participants.\". Collecting and releasing data on short positions, the rule warns, may also \"facilitate manipulative strategies targeting short sellers, such as short squeeze,\" which is what happened during the meme-stock rally. But these risks and costs don't worry. Mr. Gensler, whose single-minded aim is to increase his control over capital markets. Consider the. SEC's new proposed \"predictive data analytics\" rule, which purportedly seeks to stop what. Ms. Warren calls \"casino-like\" investing and \"gamification\". Robinhood. It would effectively prohibit many technologies that have enabled firms to offer zero-commission stock trading. The rule would require brokerage firms and investment advisors to evaluate potential conflicts of interest created by \"covered technology\" in connection with \"investor interactions\" and to eliminate or \"neutralize\" them. The definition of covered technology is so broad that it could encompass app colors and fonts, market news alerts and stock-price notifications. Under the rule,. Robinhood could be prohibited from sending customers links to news stories about a merger or regulatory enforcement action since they might trade on the information, thus benefiting. Robinhood. Retirement plan managers couldn't send \"nudges\" encouraging customers to increase their savings. As. Commissioner. Hester. Peirce noted in dissent, \"eye-wateringly detailed written policies and procedures cover every aspect of the evaluation and assessment of potential conflicts and how to handle them.\". The proposed rule even admits that firms \"might opt not to use an automated investment advice technology because of the costs associated with complying.\". The. SEC acknowledges that it can't reliably quantify the proposed rule's benefits or burdens on investors, but does note that its compliance costs would \"act as barriers to entry\" and make \"it challenging for smaller firms to compete.\". Score one for. BlackRock. The. Investment. Company. Institute noted recently in a public comment that the rule exceeds the agency's statutory authority and raises \"constitutional issues firms' ability to communicate with investors.\". Does the. SEC prefer that retail investors get advice from traders on. Reddit than from. Schwab? The short-seller and predictive data analytics rules are likely to be challenged in court. But even if they are eventually struck down, they will increase regulatory uncertainty and burdens, which will reduce market efficiency and competition. Mr. Gensler's avalanche of regulation is stress-testing. U.S. capital markets. The. SEC on his watch has finalized 27 major rules and proposed another 30 that affect every corner of the market. The administrative state marches on, whether it has the legal authority or not. Wonder. Land. Most federal employees already work from home. Let's make that permanent. Images. APiStock. Photo.

Card, whom police have identified as the suspect in the mass shootings in. Lewiston,. Maine. LEWISTON. MAINE. POLICE. DEPARTMENTASSOCIATED. PRESS 4 min. Robert. Card, the suspect in the. Wednesday shootings that killed 18 in. Maine, received inpatient psychiatric care this past summer after he started hearing voices, according to his sister-in-law,. Katie. Card. Maine. Gov. Janet. Mills said at a press conference. Thursday that 18 people were killed and 13 people were injured in the attacks. Wednesday night. Maine. State. Police worked through the night alongside local officers and the. Federal. Bureau of. Investigation to attempt to find. Card, 40 years old, their sole named suspect. Katie. Card said. Robert started hearing voices of people talking badly about him after receiving hearing aids six months to a year ago. She said the aids were to help him hear after he suffered hearing loss some years ago, and they were so sensitive he began complaining of hearing voices. \"He started believing he could hear people say awful things about him,\" said. Card, who lives with her husband and children in a home near,. Maine. \"He was convinced people were saying awful things behind his back. We tried to convince him that was not the case.\". Residents in. Lewiston,. Maine, and surrounding areas were under shelter-in-place orders as authorities search for the suspect. This summer, military reserve commanders where. Card worked as a petroleum supply specialist grew concerned over threats. Card made targeting his own unit, and had him sent to a hospital where he received inpatient psychiatric treatment for a few weeks, according to a law-enforcement official familiar with the investigation. An. Army spokesman said. Card is a sergeant first class in the. Army reserves who enlisted in. December and has no combat deployments. An undated social-media photograph of. Robert. Card, as identified . Katie. Card said her brother-in-law was allowed to check himself out of the facility voluntarily after a couple of weeks. Since then, she said he has been quiet and continued to think he heard voices. \"He thought he heard voices at multiple places out in public,\" she said by . The shooting is completely out of character with what she knows of him, she added. \"He's hard working. He's always been quiet, and so kind. This is just an acute episode, it is not who he is.\". As of. Thursday afternoon,. Robert. Card hadn't been apprehended. Authorities had issued a warrant for his arrest, and state police said more than 350 law enforcement personnel were engaged in the search. Katie. Card implored her brother-in-law to turn himself in. \"We just want him to know we love him and we can get through it,\" she said, her voice breaking while on the phone. \"But he has to turn himself in. We are praying for all the families. Our hearts are breaking for all of them.\". The. Maine legislature passed a law in to allow police to temporarily take guns away from people deemed to be a threat. Known as a \"yellow flag\" law, it is less expansive than similar \"red flag\" laws passed in 21 other states. yellow-flag law. Under the legislation, a medical practitioner is supposed to notify a law-enforcement agency in writing if a person \"is found to present a likelihood of foreseeable harm.\". Law enforcement is then supposed to take that information to a judge, who can authorize officers to temporarily take the person's guns and prohibit him or her from acquiring other firearms. Susan. Collins, a. Republican. U.S. senator from. Maine, said at a press conference. Thursday that she didn't know whether any reports were filed under the law against. Card. \"It certainly seems that on the basis of the facts that we have that the yellow-flag law should have been triggered if in fact the suspect was hospitalized for two weeks for mental illness,\" she said. \"He should have been separated from his weapons.\". It couldn't be determined whether any medical or law-enforcement personnel tried to use the yellow-flag law against. Card. A. Maine state government panel that reviews violent incidents involving police officers stated in a report earlier this year that the yellow-flag law \"is not being used on a regular and responsive basis often because of the lack of an available medical practitioner to complete an assessment.\". It urged law-enforcement agencies to use the law more often. Sadie. Gurman contributed to this article. Bags of. Cash. From. Drug. Cartels. Flood. Teller. Windows at. U.S. Banks. European. Navies.

         "U.S. Challengers argued prior maps suppressed. Black voters' power 171 3 min. Voters casting ballots at a polling location in. Atlanta. A federal judge on. Thursday ordered. Georgia to draw new congressional and state legislative maps to better represent. Black voters after finding the state's current maps violated a section of the federal. Voting. Rights. Act. A group of civil activists and religious leaders challenged the maps drawn -controlled. General. Assembly, saying the. Black community's voting power was being illegally suppressed. Attorneys for the state of. Georgia argued the state's political maps were based on partisanship rather than race. A spokesperson for the. Georgia. Attorney. General's. Office said on behalf of. Georgia. Secretary of. State. Brad. Raffensperger, a defendant in the case, that they are reviewing the order and still analyzing all legal options. U.S. District. Judge. Steve. Jones's court decision requires the. General. Assembly to create additional districts with. Black majorities by. Dec. 8. If new maps aren't produced , there will still be time for the court to fashion ones, he said. Georgia has made great strides empowering. Black voters in the years since the. Voting. Rights. Act,. Judge. Jones said in his ruling, but \"despite these great gains, the. Court determines that in certain areas of the. State, the political process is not equally open to. Black voters.\". Judge. Jones noted that in the past decade all of. Georgia's population growth was attributable to the minority population but the number of majority-Black congressional and legislative districts remained the same. Based on that,. Judge. Jones ruled the state violated. Section 2 of the. Voting. Rights. Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race. Between and ,. Georgia's white population declined 4, while its. Black population grew by 12.5, according to census data. Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued those numbers weren't properly represented during redistricting voting zones two years ago. \"We are thrilled that the. Court struck down. Georgia's congressional and state legislative maps today and outlined a clear process voters will get relief before the election, whether or not. Georgia's. General. Assembly chooses to comply with this order,\" said. Elias. Law. Group partner. Abha. Khanna, who represented the plaintiffs. The. Georgia case is one of several that. Democrats are hoping will help boost their chances of increasing their hold on. U.S. House seats in the elections. In a surprise. June ruling, the. Supreme. Court ruled that voting-rights law required. Alabama legislatures to create an additional majority-Black district. The decision ultimately led to a court-ordered congressional map where two of the state's seven. House districts have. Black majorities. The. Supreme. Court ruled in. June that state constitutions can provide grounds to strike down skewed congressional maps. In a 6-3 opinion. John. Roberts, the court found that. North. Carolina's state court didn't overstep when it struck down a congressional redistricting plan as overly partisan. A similar. Voting. Rights. Act challenge to.

         "U.S. Lawsuit filed. Boies challenges federal power,. Supreme. Court precedent. Oct. 26, 435 pm. ET 57 5 min. Lawyer. David. Boies filed a suit. Thursday seeking to strike down federal prohibition of marijuana. Once banned in. Boston, marijuana now pervades the nation, with legal sales in. Massachusetts alone grossing more than 5 billion since a state ballot measure legalized recreational use. But while dispensaries have proliferated across the country, the pot industry faces an obstacle. The federal government still classifies cannabis among the most deadly of narcotics, alongside heroin and. LSD. Looking for a remedy, a raft of reefer businesses have turned to superlawyer. David. Boies, who on. Thursday sued. Attorney. General. Merrick. Garland, seeking to strike down marijuana restrictions now in place under the federal. Controlled. Substances. Act. The suit, filed in federal district court in. Springfield,. Mass., argues the prohibition exceeds congressional authority over interstate commerce state-based businesses that don't operate across state lines. As legalization has swept the. U.S.some 38 states, three territories and the. District of. Columbia now authorize medical or recreational usethe feds largely gave up enforcing the marijuana prohibition. But pot's formal status creates tax burdens and legal obstacles to integrating the business into the banking system, said. Jason. Wild, a one-time pharmacist now running. TerrAscend, which refers to itself as a \"vertically integrated\" cannabis company. Marijuana businesses can't qualify for. Small. Business. Administration loans,. Wild said, and retailers are all-cash because credit-card companies and major banks won't touch clients with a cannabis aroma. Worst of all, he said, marijuana's prohibited status means companies can't deduct most expenses from their income, so \"you end up paying a much higher percentage of your profits, and then some,\" to. Uncle. Sam. \"An overwhelming percentage of the. American people believe that marijuana sales should be legal but also should be safe and regulated,\" said. Boies, whose high-profile cases have led to him being portrayed in films and shows as. Ed. Begley. Jr. and \"That '70s. Show\" star. Kurtwood. Smith. Massachusetts,. Boies said, has a comprehensive regulatory system that addresses policy concerns raised market. If not for federal law, he added, legal sales \"would replace the illegal marijuana trade in the same way that after. Prohibition ended, legal liquor sales essentially replaced\" the moonshine business. It took the 21st. Amendment to end. Prohibition. Boies's goal is to challenge a. Supreme. Court decision,. Gonzales v. Raich, which upheld the federal criminalization of marijuana despite a. California law authorizing its medical use. The court based its decision on a landmark precedent from ,. Wickard v. Filburn, which unanimously affirmed federal power to regulate not merely goods that themselves crossed state lines but activities that could in aggregate \"have a substantial effect\" on interstate commerce. The justices might be ready now to retire. Raich,. Boies said. \"You now have a regimen of state regulations like in. Massachusetts that control and prevent intrastate marijuana from escaping into interstate commerce,\" he said. At least as important, he added, is that today's more conservative. Supreme. Court is more skeptical of federal power. Ted. Olson, the conservative lawyer who opposed. Boies in. Bush v. Gore and later teamed with him to strike down a state ban on same-sex marriage, says his frenemy is on to something. \"His timing is good. This is the sort of thing that this court is looking at,\". Olson said. Other advocates, including gun activists, have sought to narrow the federal commerce power with limited results. Using marijuana, typically associated with more progressive jurisdictions, to sue against federal regulation might \"get a result that you wouldn't have gotten if it was brought people,\" he said. John. Q. Barrett, a law professor at. St. John's. University, says that is a reason for caution. Federal regulation of products from food to furniture could be in jeopardy, he said, if the court were to shrink. Congress's commerce power. Should the federal government be able to use its interstate commerce power to regulate marijuana commerce? Join the conversation below. The lawsuit comes as political winds favor a federal reassessment of marijuana. Senate. Majority. Leader. Chuck. Schumer. D.,. N.Y. has called for legalizing the plant, and the. Health and. Human. Services. Department has reclassifying marijuana from a. Schedule. I drug to. Schedule. III, which could remove tax burdens and other impediments facing the industry. Wild, the marijuana magnate, says that the process is dragging out too much. \"We believe at this point we need to bring all of our shots on goal,\" he said. Barrett says the litigation's side effects could be too dangerous. \"You shouldn't distort constitutional law just because the political process is lagging,\" he said. Today's cannabis companies \"are not small businesses,\" he added. \"They can afford. David. Boies, they can afford to be heard in the political process.\". Sadie. Gurman contributed to this article.
