The think tank tasked with the report, the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), “found no evidence that the number of violent extremists in the military is disproportionate” to U.S. society.

In their latest business model, trial lawyers are hired by state attorneys general to help prosecute public lawsuits then use it to the advantage of their private lawsuits. Kudos to one company for pushing back.\nIn December pharmacy benefit manager OptumRx filed a motion in federal court in Ohio to disqualify Motley Rice, a South Carolina plaintiffs firm suing the company in multidistrict opioid litigation. Motley has been retained by state attorneys general and city prosecutors in Washington, D.C., Hawaii and Chicago to handle the government’s litigation, but it continues to represent private clients in related litigation.\nThis double dipping would break the rules of professional conduct in nearly any industry, but it’s an open scandal in the tort business. In a typical arrangement, trial lawyers are hired as “special assistant attorneys general” on a given case, a designation that confers advantages during legal discovery. The lawyers then turn around and share information to benefit private lawsuits where they can make millions in contingency fees.\nIn its motion to disqualify Motley Rice, OptumRx notes that under the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct, lawyers are barred from knowingly having “confidential government information about a person, acquired when the lawyer was a public officer or employee” and from representing a “private client whose interests are adverse to that person.”\nIn its role working on state opioid lawsuits, Motley served subpoenas that required Optum to deliver what it called “wide swaths of confidential business records and testimony.” Faced with the government subpoenas, the company “produced thousands of pages of confidential information” and sent the documents “directly to Motley Rice.” With that information, Motley continued litigating its private cases against Optum and other pharmacy benefit managers on opioid matters.\nThe Optum motion, along with the consolidated opioid litigation, is before federal Judge Aaron Polster, who has pushed the parties to reach settlements. In a recent telephone hearing, Judge Polster is reported to have told OptumRx lawyer Brian Boone that he should think twice about filing the disqualification motion against the trial lawyers, whom he considers to be cooperative.\n“Your clients need to understand if they file these motions, it will be very difficult to maintain that level of professional cooperation, and that will clearly have negative repercussions for your clients,” Judge Polster said, according to Law360, a legal news website which got a transcript of the hearing. “I don’t need to spell it out. But if they’re not listening you ought to explain to them exactly what I mean.”\nThat’s loud and clear. Judge Polster is discouraging Optum’s lawyers from filing a motion that reflects poorly on Motley Rice. But if companies can’t challenge the trial lawyers’ alliance with state attorneys general, they are destined to be saddled with bills for the opioid epidemic regardless of legal liability. The opioid crisis is a tragedy with many causes, but using government authority for the enrichment of the trial bar is not a triumph of justice.\nAdvertisement\nJournal Editorial Report: Medicare's \"negotiation\" with pharmaceutical companies will slow the development of new cures.

         "Title: Xi Jinping Says Happy New Year\n\nAdvertisement\nOPINION\nREVIEW & OUTLOOK\nFollow\nXi Jinping Says Happy New Year\nChina’s leader tries to influence Taiwan’s Jan. 13 election.\nBy\nThe Editorial Board\nFollow\nJan. 1, 2024 5:43 pm ET\n129\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(2 min)\nChinese President Xi Jinping delivers 2024 New Year address, Beijing, Dec. 31, 2023 PHOTO: WU HAO/SHUTTERSTOCK\nChina’s Supreme Leader Xi Jinping offered his traditional New Year’s greeting Monday with a warning. “The reunification of the motherland is a historical inevitability,” Mr. Xi said, according to the Chinese-language version documented by various news sources.\n“Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should be bound by a common sense of purpose and share in the glory of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” he added. The official English translation wrote “all Chinese” rather than “compatriots,” according to a Reuters dispatch.\nThe language comes 12 days before Taiwan’s voters go to the polls in a hotly contested three-way race for President. Chinese propaganda is working hard against front-runner Lai Ching-te, the current vice president and presidential nominee of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Mr. Lai and his party are obstacles to coerced reunification.\nOne big question for the New Year is how does China react if Mr. Lai wins? Does Mr. Xi tell his military to increase its harassment of Taiwan airspace and waters? Or, with two hot wars around the word and an election year in the U.S. that is likely to be highly divisive, will he try something more daring?\nThe White House thinks its recent parlays with Beijing have put U.S.-China bilateral relations on a more stable course. Perhaps that’s right.

Chinese propaganda is working hard against front-runner. Lai. Ching-te, the current vice president and presidential nominee of the ruling. Democratic.

That action was described at the time as “limited self-defense strikes,” and they were carried out after the Houthis fired missiles at a U.S. destroyer. The Biden administration has been more cautious in the face of persistent Houthi attacks against commercial shipping, as it seeks to avoid broadening the fighting in the region.\nOn Saturday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Grant Shapps, the British defense secretary.

The lack of cooking gas has forced people to burn wood, or even garbage, to cook.\nAdvertisement\n“People here live amid garbage, all of us are sick, the smoke from the fires we burn makes us feel more sick,” said Swairki. “The situation is just getting worse.”\nEven as Israel announced the changes to its deployment, analysts say any shift to lower-intensity fighting is possible only as Israel establishes operational control over an area, meaning its forces can maneuver freely in the zone.\nNearly three months into Israel’s war against Hamas and other militants in the Gaza Strip, Israel says it has broken the main command-and-control lines in the enclave’s north and weakened them in the south, but small groups of Hamas fighters continue to ambush Israeli forces and fire rockets toward Israel from across the Strip.\nOn Monday morning, Hamas showed it has retained long-range rocket capabilities by launching an intense barrage at Tel Aviv at the stroke of midnight.\nTwo of the five Israeli brigades set to rotate out of Gaza are reservists, some of whom the military said will be demobilized. The remaining three are training brigades, which can be quickly redeployed into battle as needed.\nSince the start of the invasion of Gaza, 173 Israeli soldiers have died and more than 900 have been wounded, according to the Israeli military.\nA tent camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah.

         "Title: Israel’s Highest Court Strikes Down Controversial Law to Curb Its Power\n\nAdvertisement\nWORLD\nMIDDLE EAST\nIsrael’s Highest Court Strikes Down Controversial Law to Curb Its Power\nThe law was centerpiece of judicial overhaul pursued by Netanyahu’s government before Gaza war erupted\nBy Carrie Keller-Lynn and\nAnat Peled\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 1, 2024 4:17 pm ET\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(7 min)\nIsrael’s Supreme Court has struck down a law passed in July that would have taken away the court’s powers to abrogate government decisions it deems to be ‘unreasonable in the extreme.’ PHOTO: DEBBIE HILL/REUTERS\nTEL AVIV—Israel’s highest court has struck down a controversial judicial overhaul law enacted last year by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that would have limited the justices’ power.\nWhile the broader overhaul sparked some of the worst political and social strife in Israel in years, political leaders—including Netanyahu and his allies—have signaled that they will not fight Monday’s ruling while the country is embroiled in a devastating war in Gaza.\nThe law, which was passed in July and was akin to a constitutional amendment, would have taken away the court’s powers to abrogate government decisions it deems to be “unreasonable in the extreme.”\nEight justices ruled in favor of striking down the law, with seven against it.\nThe ruling comes with the country still reeling from the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities.\nBefore the attack, hundreds of thousands of Israelis came out weekly to protest against Netanyahu’s push to weaken the powers of the court.\nAnalysts say Monday’s ruling could have substantial consequences for postwar domestic politics, including any inquiry into the intelligence failures leading up to Oct. 7.\nThe ruling could eventually reignite a divisive national debate and provoke a constitutional crisis. And if Netanyahu seeks to overturn the ruling in the short term, it could cause cracks to form within the multiparty emergency coalition formed to lead the country during the war.\nBut for the moment, Israelis are focused on the war effort.\nThousands of Israelis took part in a protest march last July against the judicial overhaul plans. PHOTO: ABIR SULTAN/SHUTTERSTOCK\n“The public doesn’t care about the judicial thing so much anymore,” said Barak Medina, a legal scholar and professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\nGroups that led the protests against the judicial overhaul welcomed the ruling but said a return to prewar divisions during the conflict was unlikely. “We are in the midst of the longest and most horrible war in our history,” said Lee Hoffman Agiv, of the protest group Bonot Alternativa, or Building an Alternative. “There won’t be celebrations here.”\nThe law was part of a broader package of legislation aimed at limiting the court’s power and giving more control to lawmakers. Netanyahu has argued that activist, liberal judges control the court and that the legislation seeks to restore a proper balance of power. Opponents charge that the legislation would undermine the court’s role as a check on executive and legislative power and would erode Israel’s liberal democracy.\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWhat’s News\nCatch up on the headlines, understand the news and make better decisions, free in your inbox daily.

Since the mid-1990s, the court has interpreted them as the country’s constitution.\nIn a decision that could have wide repercussions, the court also ruled 12-3 that it has the right to strike down a basic law in “unusual and extreme cases” when it goes against the core principles of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.\n“This is really an unprecedented decision because it is the first time in the history of the state where the court strikes down a basic law” that is equivalent to a constitutional amendment, said Yaniv Roznai, a law professor at Reichman University in central Israel.\nThe court had never before struck down one of the basic laws, but had opined in various decisions that it had the authority to do so if the laws would alter the basic democratic character of the country.\nNetanyahu’s Likud party criticized the court’s ruling, saying that “it is unfortunate that the Supreme Court chose to issue a decision at the heart of Israel’s social divisions, precisely when [Israeli] soldiers” from across the political spectrum “are fighting and risking their lives.”\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sought to limit the court’s powers and give more control to the elected government.

         "7 min. Israel's. Supreme. Court has struck down a law passed in. July that would have taken away the court's powers to abrogate government decisions it deems to be 'unreasonable in the extreme.'. TEL. AVIVIsrael's highest court has struck down a controversial judicial overhaul law enacted last year of. Prime. Minister. Benjamin. Netanyahu that would have limited the justices' power. While the broader overhaul sparked some of the worst political and social strife in. Israel in years, political leadersincluding. Netanyahu and his allieshave signaled that they will not fight. Monday's ruling while the country is embroiled in a devastating war in. Gaza. The law, which was passed in. July and was akin to a constitutional amendment, would have taken away the court's powers to abrogate government decisions it deems to be \"unreasonable in the extreme.\". Eight justices ruled in favor of striking down the law, with seven against it. The ruling comes with the country still reeling from the. Oct. 7 attack on southern. Israel that killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to. Israeli authorities. Before the attack, hundreds of thousands of. Israelis came out weekly to protest against. Netanyahu's push to weaken the powers of the court. Analysts say. Monday's ruling could have substantial consequences for postwar domestic politics, including any inquiry into the intelligence failures leading up to. Oct. 7. The ruling could eventually reignite a divisive national debate and provoke a constitutional crisis. And if. Netanyahu seeks to overturn the ruling in the short term, it could cause cracks to form within the multiparty emergency coalition formed to lead the country during the war. But for the moment,. Israelis are focused on the war effort. Thousands of. Israelis took part in a protest march last. July against the judicial overhaul plans. \"The public doesn't care about the judicial thing so much anymore,\" said. Barak. Medina, a legal scholar and professor at the. Hebrew. University of. Jerusalem. Groups that led the protests against the judicial overhaul welcomed the ruling but said a return to prewar divisions during the conflict was unlikely. \"We are in the midst of the longest and most horrible war in our history,\" said. Lee. Hoffman. Agiv, of the protest group. Bonot. Alternativa, or. Building an. Alternative. \"There won't be celebrations here.\". The law was part of a broader package of legislation aimed at limiting the court's power and giving more control to lawmakers. Netanyahu has argued that activist, liberal judges control the court and that the legislation seeks to restore a proper balance of power. Opponents charge that the legislation would undermine the court's role as a check on executive and legislative power and would erode. Israel's liberal democracy. Israel has no written constitution like the. U.S. and relies on a series of basic laws, which have special, quasi-constitutional status and delineate the basic tenets of the state such as electoral procedures, minting currency, and individual rights. Since the mid-s, the court has interpreted them as the country's constitution. In a decision that could have wide repercussions, the court also ruled 12-3 that it has the right to strike down a basic law in \"unusual and extreme cases\" when it goes against the core principles of. Israel as a. Jewish and democratic state. \"This is really an unprecedented decision because it is the first time in the history of the state where the court strikes down a basic law\" that is equivalent to a constitutional amendment, said. Yaniv. Roznai, a law professor at. Reichman. University in central. Israel. The court had never before struck down one of the basic laws, but had opined in various decisions that it had the authority to do so if the laws would alter the basic democratic character of the country. Netanyahu's. Likud party criticized the court's ruling, saying that \"it is unfortunate that the. Supreme. Court chose to issue a decision at the heart of. Israel's social divisions, precisely when. Israeli soldiers\" from across the political spectrum \"are fighting and risking their lives.\". Prime. Minister. Benjamin. Netanyahu has sought to limit the court's powers and give more control to the elected government. Justice. Minister. Yariv. Levin, considered the judicial overhaul's chief architect, said the court's ruling \"takes away from millions of citizens their vote and the basic right to be equal partners in decision-making.\". Levin has long argued that elected leaders should have more influence over the courts and their authority. Opposition. Leader. Yair. Lapid praised the decision as protecting. Israeli democracy. \"If the. Israeli government again starts the fight over the. Supreme. Court,\". Lapid said, then \"they learned nothing on. Oct. 7.\". The. Netanyahu government's judicial overhaul plan divided the country before the war, with some arguing that it conveyed weakness to. Israel's enemies and influenced the timing of the. Hamas attack. The ruling coalition has several options if it chooses to oppose the ruling, say legal analysts. This includes passing a more nuanced version of the reasonableness amendment or passing basic law legislation that would limit the ability of the court to strike down basic laws. President. Biden had urged. Netanyahu to slow down and seek a consensus with the political opposition on changes to the country's. Supreme. Court. Monday's ruling comes at a critical time for. Netanyahu, who has faced blowback at home about. Israel's failure to prevent. Hamas's. Oct. 7 attacks. The longtime leader has pushed back, saying that questions about his personal responsibility would be dealt with in a postwar inquiry. Without.

         "Title: Making Discrimination OK Again\n\nAdvertisement\nOPINION\nMAIN STREET\nMaking Discrimination OK Again\nThe losers in a 2020 California referendum are back again with a sneakier version.\nBy\nWilliam McGurn\nFollow\nJan. 1, 2024 2:55 pm ET\n649\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(5 min)\nPHOTO: UNCREDITED\nDo they ever give up? Those looking to divvy up Americans by race, that is.\nIn California they tried to get race preferences approved in a 2020 referendum, but voters rejected it 57.2% to 42.8%. This was a stunning rebuke, not only because the rejection came from residents of a blue state but because the losing side had outspent opponents something like 14 to 1.\nIn 2023 the Supreme Court weighed in with a landmark ruling that barred colleges from treating people as members of a racial group instead of as individuals—and cast constitutional doubt on all race-based preferences. “Eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. Couldn’t be clearer, right?\nNot in California. Undaunted state Assemblyman Corey Jackson is pushing a bill called ACA7. It takes aim at the state ban on race preferences that voters put in the constitution in 1996 when they passed Proposition 209. Californians reaffirmed Proposition 209 three years ago at the ballot box.\nThe language the voters agreed to and the activists hate reads as follows: “The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.”\nUnlike the 2020 effort, the new bill would leave that language intact. Instead, it would add a provision allowing the governor to create “exceptions.” Effectively that would gut the ban.\nApparently, the lesson the advocates of state-sponsored discrimination have taken from their defeat is that if at first you don’t succeed, try something sneakier.\nHere is Mr. Jackson’s press release summarizing the bill: “ACA7 will allow . . . the Governor to issue waivers to public agencies that wish to use state funds for research-based, or research-informed and culturally specific interventions to increase life expectancy, improve educational outcomes, and lift people out of poverty for specific ethnic groups and marginalized genders.”\nGail Heriot is a University of San Diego law professor who sits on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and was a leader of both Proposition 209 and the “no” effort on the 2020 referendum. She has launched a petition with Extremely Concerned Californians at change.org opposing the measure.\n“ACA7’s proponents are hoping that voters will be fooled into thinking that it is just a small exception,” Ms. Heriot says. “In fact, it gives the governor enormous power to nullify Proposition 209.”\nEdward Blum agrees. As the founder of Students for Fair Admissions, he spearheaded the lawsuits against Harvard and the University of North Carolina that killed race preferences in college admissions.\n“Racial preferences are never legally justified because some specious ‘research’ report concludes it would be beneficial to a certain race,” says Mr. Blum. “This exemption will trigger endless litigation that will polarize California citizens by race.”\nBut sowing discord is a feature, not a bug. As the bill was making its way through the Assembly, Mr. Jackson got in a spat with Bill Essayli—a Republican who is also the first Muslim elected to the Assembly. Mr. Essayli pointed out that the majority of Californian voters disagree with state-sanctioned discrimination. “I fundamentally disagree with this backwards policy,” he later tweeted.\nMr. Jackson responded in his own tweet: “This is a perfect example how a minority can become a white supremacist by doing everything possible to win white supremacist and fascist affection.”\nACA7 passed the state Assembly in September. If it passes the Senate, it will be on the ballot in November. If Californians vote yea, it will become part of the constitution.\nBut all is not lost. The 2020 referendum awakened a sleeping giant: the Asian-American community. Asian-Americans quickly realized (as the Harvard case drove home) that they and their children are the primary victims whenever race is substituted for merit. Asian-Americans are more aware and organized than they were in 2020. They aren’t likely to be fooled by talk of “exceptions” based on “research.”\nIt also isn’t a given that ACA7 will make it through the state Senate. Though Democrats enjoy a 32-8 majority, polls consistently show race preferences are unpopular. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s support will be crucial.\nThough he has no formal role in the constitutional process, some think the bill will go nowhere if Mr. Newsom doesn’t want it to. If it does make it to the ballot this November, he’ll be under immense pressure to endorse it. That’s another reason the Senate should kill ACA7 now, Ms. Heriot says.\n“California voters need to make sure their state senators know where they stand—through emails, phone calls, letters, and petitions,” Ms. Heriot says. “Once the senators understand that, they will realize putting ACA7 on the ballot is not in their interest.”\nWrite to mcgurn@wsj.com\nAdvertisement\nJournal Editorial Report: Colleges vow to keep race a factor in admissions.

         "Title: Does Biden Want Ukraine to Win?\n\nAdvertisement\nOPINION\nCOMMENTARY\nFollow\nDoes Biden Want Ukraine to Win?\nBy not arming Kyiv for a long-range campaign against Russia, the U.S. seems to be forcing a deal.\nBy Phillips P. O’Brien\nJan. 1, 2024 2:53 pm ET\n827\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(6 min)\nU.S. troops launch Himars during joint exercises in East Java, Indonesia, Sept. 11, 2023. PHOTO: JUNI KRISWANTO/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nPresident Biden on Friday denounced Russia for having “launched its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since this war began.” The attack used some 158 missiles and drones to hit targets throughout the country. “It is a stark reminder to the world,” Mr. Biden said, that Vladimir Putin “seeks to obliterate Ukraine and subjugate its people. He must be stopped.”\nYet while Russia can strike anywhere in Ukraine, the U.S. has denied the Ukrainians the weapons they need to hit Russian targets, even in the parts of Ukraine that Russia occupies. This raises the question: Does Mr. Biden want Ukraine to win?\nHe has spoken about standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine, about helping the country “for as long as it takes” and about not letting Mr. Putin win. But the administration has never made a clear commitment to a Ukrainian victory—to helping the country liberate all its legally recognized territory and become part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\nPerhaps the reason for this reluctance is obvious: The Biden administration doesn’t want Ukraine to win. Instead, there are signs the administration wants to force a sordid deal on Kyiv, one in which Ukrainians hand over large parts of their country, including Crimea, to Mr. Putin. The best evidence of this is that the administration has bent over backward not to supply Ukraine with the weapons needed to hit Russian targets in Crimea.\nWhile the U.S. has pumped about $50 billion of weaponry into Ukraine, what it has given is rather one-dimensional. Washington has mostly sent weapons of limited range (howitzers, artillery, fighting vehicles and ammunition) and defensive weapons such as Patriot antiair systems. The administration has temporized about sending longer-range weapons, even though the U.S. has large stocks of them.\nOne example is the limited way the U.S. has supplied Ukraine with Himars ammunition. First appearing on the battlefield in early summer 2022, U.S.-made Himars, an acronym for High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, showed their value with great accuracy and punch. Ukraine used Himars to devastate Russian ammunition and supply depots, helping stop the Russian army in its tracks and leading to the liberation of much Ukrainian territory around Kharkiv and Kherson.\nYet the administration limited the type of Himars ammunition it provided, making sure the Ukrainians could attack Russian forces only within about 50 miles of the front—leaving Crimea off-limits. Predictably, after a few weeks of seeing their depots exploding, the Russians moved their supply points more than 50 miles from the front, many to Crimea. The Ukrainians had no way to hit them.\nThe administration’s action had to be deliberate, as the U.S. has significant stores of Himars ammunition, known as ATACMS (for Army Tactical Missile Systems), which could reach targets in the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine. No matter how often the Ukrainians asked for ATACMS, the answer was, until recently, no.\nFinally in October, the U.S. sent Ukraine around 20 ATACMS. Ukraine used them against Russian military helicopters and other targets that had been out of range. However far too few ATACMS were sent. After a handful of successful operations, Ukraine seems to have run out.\nIn depriving the Ukrainians of the ability to mount a sustained, long-range campaign against Russia, the administration is leaving Kyiv without the capability it needs to win. The ground war at the front in 2023 has made it clear that direct advances against prepared defensive positions are almost impossible. Both in the spring around the city of Bakhmut and in the autumn around Avdiivka, the Russians made very slow progress at the cost of mass casualties and crippling equipment losses. The Ukrainians, when supplied with Western tanks and vehicles, struggled to advance this summer.\nIn comparison, long-range weapons have been very effective. In 2023 the U.K. and France sent Ukraine a few hundred of their Storm Shadow/Scalp cruise missiles. The systems are similar but have different names. These missiles enabled Ukrainians to hit targets anywhere in Crimea and to neuter Russian naval power in the peninsula.\nThe Storm Shadow/Scalps played a crucial role in the Ukrainian attack on Sevastopol in September. Sevastopol was the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, and Moscow considered it relatively safe. Within moments, fire rained down on the base, damaging two major warships so badly that they haven’t operated since. Last week the Ukrainians used Storm Shadow/Scalps to sink the landing ship Novocherkassk in Crimea.\nThe attack underscores Crimea’s vulnerability to long-range fire. Only the Kerch Bridge connects it to Russia. As the Russians are being driven from the naval bases, they will become almost entirely reliant on the bridge. If the Ukrainians could stop movement across it, Russian rule over Crimea would be threatened. The U.S. has many systems in addition to ATACMS, such as Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles, that could help, but it isn’t offering them.\nArming Ukraine with long-range systems would help Ukraine liberate Crimea and end the war sooner, saving lives on both sides. An administration that wants Ukraine to win should see that and act accordingly. If the Biden administration continues to hem and haw, after all we have seen in recent months, we can stop asking whether it wants Ukraine to win the war. The answer would be no.\nMr. O’Brien is a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland.\nAdvertisement\nThe '2023 Reagan National Defense Survey' highlights China as the greatest national security threat to the U.S. and finds strong support for arming Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

The administration has temporized about sending longer-range weapons, even though the. U.S. has large stocks of them. One example is the limited way the. U.S. has supplied. Ukraine with. Himars ammunition. First appearing on the battlefield in early summer ,. U.S.-made. Himars, an acronym for. High-Mobility. Artillery. Rocket. Systems, showed their value with great accuracy and punch. Ukraine used. Himars to devastate. Russian ammunition and supply depots, helping stop the. Russian army in its tracks and leading to the liberation of much. Ukrainian territory around. Kharkiv and. Kherson. Yet the administration limited the type of. Himars ammunition it provided, making sure the. Ukrainians could attack. Russian forces only within about 50 miles of the frontleaving. Crimea off-limits. Predictably, after a few weeks of seeing their depots exploding, the. Russians moved their supply points more than 50 miles from the front, many to. Crimea. The. Ukrainians had no way to hit them. The administration's action had to be deliberate, as the. U.S. has significant stores of. Himars ammunition, known as. ATACMS for. Army. Tactical. Missile. Systems, which could reach targets in the internationally recognized territory of. Ukraine. No matter how often the. Ukrainians asked for. ATACMS, the answer was, until recently, no. Finally in. October, the. U.S. sent. Ukraine around 20. ATACMS. Ukraine used them against. Russian military helicopters and other targets that had been out of range. However far too few. ATACMS were sent. After a handful of successful operations,. Ukraine seems to have run out. In depriving the. Ukrainians of the ability to mount a sustained, long-range campaign against. Russia, the administration is leaving. Kyiv without the capability it needs to win. The ground war at the front in has made it clear that direct advances against prepared defensive positions are almost impossible. Both in the spring around the city of. Bakhmut and in the autumn around. Avdiivka, the. Russians made very slow progress at the cost of mass casualties and crippling equipment losses. The. Ukrainians, when supplied with. Western tanks and vehicles, struggled to advance this summer. In comparison, long-range weapons have been very effective. In the. U.K. and. France sent. Ukraine a few hundred of their. Storm. ShadowScalp cruise missiles. The systems are similar but have different names. These missiles enabled. Ukrainians to hit targets anywhere in. Crimea and to neuter. Russian naval power in the peninsula. The. Storm. ShadowScalps played a crucial role in the. Ukrainian attack on. Sevastopol in. September. Sevastopol was the headquarters of the. Russian. Black. Sea. Fleet, and. Moscow considered it relatively safe. Within moments, fire rained down on the base, damaging two major warships so badly that they haven't operated since. Last week the. Ukrainians used. Storm. ShadowScalps to sink the landing ship. Novocherkassk in. Crimea. The attack underscores. Crimea's vulnerability to long-range fire. Only the. Kerch. Bridge connects it to. Russia. As the. Russians are being driven from the naval bases, they will become almost entirely reliant on the bridge. If the. Ukrainians could stop movement across it,. Russian rule over. Crimea would be threatened. The. U.S. has many systems in addition to. ATACMS, such as. Joint. Air-to-Surface. Standoff. Missiles, that could help, but it isn't offering them. Arming. Ukraine with long-range systems would help. Ukraine liberate. Crimea and end the war sooner, saving lives on both sides. An administration that wants. Ukraine to win should see that and act accordingly. If the. Biden administration continues to hem and haw, after all we have seen in recent months, we can stop asking whether it wants. Ukraine to win the war. The answer would be no. Mr. O'Brien is a professor of strategic studies at the. University of. St. Andrews,. Scotland. The '. Reagan. National. Defense. Survey' highlights.

Roosevelt referred to as the nation’s “arsenal of democracy.”\nChinese leaders have articulated a long-term national strategy to achieve the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts,” including developing a world-class military. Over the past decade, the Chinese Communist Party has ramped up defense industrial production and significantly improved its process of researching, developing and producing advanced weapons systems. As Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall III recently observed, China is preparing “specifically for a war with the U.S.”\nChina’s defense industrial efforts have strengthened its military capabilities. The People’s Liberation Army is amassing a formidable arsenal of medium- and long-range precision missiles capable of striking U.S. and allied bases in the Indo-Pacific. The PLA is also building a web of integrated air-defense systems to challenge U.S. forces in the region. Three of the world’s 10 largest defense companies are now Chinese enterprises: Aviation Industry Corp. of China, China North Industries Group and China South Industries Group.\nThe main beneficiary of China’s defense industrial growth is arguably the PLA’s navy. China is now the world’s largest shipbuilder by a significant margin. Its shipbuilding capacity is more than 230 times as large as the U.S.’s, allowing it to build 23 million tons of vessels, compared with less than 100,000 tons in the U.S. One Chinese shipyard, the Jiangnan Shipyard located on Changxing Island, has more capacity than all U.S. shipyards combined, according to U.S. Navy estimates.\nBeijing’s buildup should be a blinking red light for Washington. The U.S. defense industrial base lacks the capacity, responsiveness, flexibility and surge capability to meet the military’s needs. Part of the problem is that the U.S. defense industrial base remains on a peacetime footing, despite wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as growing tension in the Taiwan Strait and Korean Peninsula.\nThe U.S. faces a serious shortfall of munitions—especially long-range precision munitions—for a protracted war in the Indo-Pacific. That is owing in some part to Congress’s dragging its feet in fixing contracting problems, such as multiyear procurement. Supply-chain challenges remain serious, too, leading to an insufficient supply of solid rocket motors, ball bearings, microelectronics, and seekers for munitions. Today’s workforce is also inadequate to meet the demands of the defense industrial base.\nYet the U.S. private sector is the most innovative in the world, and it boasts a strong track record of revitalizing its defense industrial base during periods of crisis, such as during World War II and the Cold War. There is, however, a long way to go.\nA good place to start is at the White House. Presidents Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan established defense production boards to provide strategic guidance, oversee U.S. defense production, fix bureaucratic problems among executive agencies, and provide a sense of urgency. A national-level body is critical to oversee such a project of revitalization.\nThe Defense Department and Congress should also allocate additional funding and other enticements—such as tax incentives, regulatory relief and long-term contracts—to build and maintain production capacity. This funding could be used to modernize and expand defense facilities and develop flexible production. These steps will likely require an increase in defense spending. The U.S. is spending roughly 3% of its gross domestic product on defense, compared with 14% under Truman, 11% under Eisenhower, 9% under John F. Kennedy and more than 6% under Reagan.\nFDR in December 1940, a year before Pearl Harbor, implored the nation to revitalize its defense industry: “We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war.” We need to heed that advice again before it’s too late.\nMr. Jones is senior vice president and director of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nAdvertisement\nThe '2023 Reagan National Defense Survey' highlights China as the greatest national security threat to the U.S. and finds strong support for arming Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

PHOTO: DAVID PAUL MORRIS/BLOOMBERG NEWS\nIt didn’t get a lot of attention, but last month the White House awarded $3.1 billion to the California High-Speed Rail project. This was supposed to be a bullet train connecting San Francisco and Los Angeles in less than three hours. Instead, its costs keep rising even as the state scales back the plan. Since 2008, when California voters authorized a $10 billion bond issue for the train, they’ve been sold a bill of goods.\nThe original total estimated construction cost to taxpayers was $33 billion. That’s risen to at least $100 billion. The authority decided to offer service between San Francisco and Los Angeles in Phase I, then eventually extend the train service north to Sacramento and south to San Diego. Phase I was to have been completed by 2020.\nWithin five years of the bond approval, costs had soared so high that the California High-Speed Rail Authority had to adopt an emergency plan to contain them. One idea was to slow down the trains by having them share tracks with conventional commuter trains in parts of the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas. That reduced projected costs by billions of dollars—but made a mockery of the “high speed” rail claim.\nIn 2019 newly inaugurated Gov. Gavin Newsom declared that because of construction complications and cost overruns, the train would initially travel only down a 171-mile segment between Merced (a 130-mile drive from San Francisco) and Bakersfield (110 miles from Los Angeles). That segment was to cost $22.8 billion.\nThen the California High-Speed Rail Peer Review Committee dropped another bomb: The San Francisco to Los Angeles phase would take another 15 to 20 years to build, would cost three times as much as projected, and would be unable to meet legally mandated trip times.\nAbout the same time, the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office highlighted a $10 billion to $12 billion funding shortfall for the Merced-to-Bakersfield segment, though only a year before the California High-Speed Rail Authority’s 2022 Business Plan had said “revenues would be roughly equivalent to costs.” The federal grant will pay for less than one-third of the year’s cost overrun.\nIn legislative testimony, Louis S. Thompson, chairman of the Peer Review Committee, put the Phase I funding gap at $93 billion to $103 billion. He also noted there is at least an $8 billion increase that hasn’t been counted in the Southern California segment. “Even with a realistic share of new federal funding,” he said, “the project cannot get outside the Central Valley without added state or local funding.” The Legislative Analyst’s Office agreed.\nFuture cost escalation seems likely on the San Francisco and Los Angeles legs of Phase I, with massive tunneling through the Tehachapi Mountains toward Los Angeles and below the Coast Range toward San Francisco.\nThe committee concluded that “there is no existing federal program anywhere near the scale or sustaining level needed. There will need to be significant and sustained additional State funding on a predictable and adequate level.” But the Legislative Analysts’s Office has announced a $68 billion deficit, slamming that window shut for now—unless more federal money is on the way.\nMeanwhile, Florida has a new rail system up and running between Orlando and Miami, with all private financing.

He’s so French, he bakes bread for Macron.\nBy Tunku Varadarajan\nJan. 1, 2024 2:47 pm ET\n147\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(4 min)\nTharshan Selvarajah at his boulangerie. PHOTO: TUNKU VARADARAJAN\nParis\n‘Our president eats my bread every morning,” Tharshan Selvarajah says as he sips a beer at 10 a.m.\nToo early for a tipple? Have a heart. Mr. Selvarajah was up before 4, baking baguettes at his boulangerie next door. It’s called Au Levain des Pyrénées (Sourdough of the Pyrénées), the name given by its previous owner, from whom he bought it in 2021. He was at the Élysée Palace at 7 a.m. sharp, 50 baguettes in the back of his little white van. “I came to France from the war in Sri Lanka in 2005. I was 18 with $50 in my pocket,” he says in English still accented with his native Tamil. “Now I’m 37, and I deliver baguettes seven days a week to Monsieur Macron.”\nThis baker is a local hero. The waiter doesn’t charge him for the beer. We’re at a small bar in the 20th arrondissement, a dowdy part of eastern Paris to which few people come without good reason—and mine is impeccable: Mr. Selvarajah makes the best baguette in the city.\nIn 2023 he won the Grand Prize of the Traditional French Baguette, finishing first in a blind tasting in which 126 Parisian bakers vied for victory. Winning the annual contest confers on the victor “the honor” (Mr. Selvarajah’s words) of supplying the French president with bread for a year. The 18 jurors prodded, sniffed, tasted and masticated before settling on a winning baguette. Mr. Selvarajah wept when he learned he’d won.\nThis Tamil man embodies a spirit of integration that the French yearn for in their immigrants, many of whom find it hard to embrace France as completely as Mr. Selvarajah has. “French people are good people,” he says. “They like you if you learn their culture.” He’s still Hindu—beholden to the deity Shiva—and speaks Tamil at home with his Sri Lankan-born wife. Their two children speak “the best French,” he tells me, and go to private school for “the best education.” He wants his 7-year-old daughter to be “a French judge,” and his son, 4, to be “a heart surgeon.” Mr. Selvarajah’s father had wanted him to be a lawyer.\nDuring his undocumented years, he washed dishes at an Italian restaurant in Paris, sleeping on park benches if he got off work too late for the last train home to the outer suburbs. As his French improved, he waited tables and befriended a customer—the owner of Au Levain des Pyrénées—who came in for pasta every week. When the Italian joint closed in 2009, the baker hired him as an apprentice, teaching him to make baguettes, croissants and pains au chocolat, the holy trinity of any boulangerie. It took the Tamil two years to master the French art of the baguette—“using only flour, water, salt and yeast. I learned, learned, learned.” By 2012 he was chief baguette-maker. By 2018 he’d rented the bakery. Three years later, he bought it.\nAfter we chat we go to the bakery, where Mr. Selvarajah hands me a baguette that’s warm to the touch. I break off a piece and chew. “How is the taste?” he asks. He knows the answer: It’s excellent, and I say so.\nWhat I don’t express aloud is another truth. The taste of the baguette is the taste of assimilation.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Varadarajan, a Journal contributor, is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and at NYU Law School’s Classical Liberal Institute.\nAppeared in the January 2, 2024, print edition as 'Add Flour and Salt and Assimilate'.\nSHOW CONVERSATION (147)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nMarine Le Pen Found Guilty of Embezzlement, Banned From Next Election\nIf Vaccines Don’t Cause Autism, What Does?\nMike Waltz Is Losing Support Inside the White House\nNo More Mr. Nice Guy.

PHOTO: TOM WILLIAMS/ZUMA PRESS\nWest Mifflin, Pa.\nIt’s a warm December morning, and Sen. John Fetterman is walking along the Great Allegheny Passage across the Monongahela River from his home in Braddock. “I spend as much time as I can out here,” he says of the trail, which runs 150 miles from downtown Pittsburgh to Cumberland, Md.\nOPINION: POTOMAC WATCH\nWhat Were the Most Significant Stories of 2023?\n26:47\n1x\nSUBSCRIBE\nAdd to Queue\nExplore Audio Center\nMr. Fetterman has been in the U.S. Senate just under a year, during which he’s recovered from a campaign-season stroke, checked himself into Walter Reed hospital for depression, and ruffled feathers on both sides of the aisle. In September it was reported that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had relaxed the Senate’s unofficial dress code to accommodate Mr. Fetterman’s preference for wearing hoodies and shorts. (That move backfired, leading the body to adopt a formal requirement of business attire.)\nOf late, however, Mr. Fetterman has drawn the ire of the Democratic left for his unapologetic support of Israel, for his support of a bipartisan solution to the border crisis, and for his cheeky criticisms of the indicted Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.).\nNone of this is a surprise to Pennsylvania political observers. “Now that his health has finally improved, the national press and the country are finding out the real John Fetterman,” says Jeffrey Brauer, a political scientist at Keystone College. Mr. Brauer thinks that Mr. Fetterman’s difficulty communicating after his May 2022 stroke, combined with his casual dress and his combative approach to moderate primary opponent Conor Lamb led outsiders to assume Mr. Fetterman was a card-carrying progressive.\nIn an interview with the Journal, Mr. Fetterman says that assumption was mistaken: “I had been stating clearly that I’m not a progressive, I’m not that kind of a label or anything like that,” he says. “I said that before the primary in ’22, and that’s how I’ve always believed. And I think these have all been very easy calls. I follow the moral clarity, not the polls or any silly labels.”\nMr. Fetterman declared last week that “I would be the last man standing to be absolutely there on the Israeli side on this with no conditions.” Last month he blamed both parties for what he described as a reflexive political resistance to a border security deal. “Since you’ve covered me for years,” he says, “you know me, and you know my wife, and I’ve been very clear and supportive of immigration; I think it’s been part of what has made America, America.” Mr. Fetterman’s wife, Gisele, was 7 when her Brazilian mother brought her to the U.S. illegally. She naturalized in 2009.\n“Two things can be true at the same time,” the senator continues. “We do have a crisis on the border—and we have to look at the numbers that are the size of Pittsburgh showing up on the border. You can’t just say, ‘Oh yeah, OK. It’ll all work itself out.’ ” He sees border security as a matter of common sense: “I think if you really want to address immigration in the way that it deserves, we first must also have a secure border.”\nSince becoming mayor of Braddock in 2006, Mr. Fetterman has often bucked the local and state Democratic Party. In 2016, he ran in a U.S. Senate primary against eventual nominee Katie McGinty. He supported Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton that year and made party officials cringe when he warned that Donald Trump could win Pennsylvania in that year’s general election—as he did. “Anyone that spent time across Pennsylvania would have realized how popular he was and how he connected at a very deep level,” Mr. Fetterman now says.\nIn 2018, Mr. Fetterman ran for lieutenant governor and surprised everyone—including then-Gov. Tom Wolf—by defeating the incumbent, Michael Stack, making him the state’s first lieutenant governor to lose in a primary election. Mr. Fetterman made local activists unhappy along the way, mostly over his support for the natural-gas industry.\nMr. Brauer says Mr. Fetterman has emerged as a center-left senator in a style akin to that of West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema. “What is most interesting is that while the Pennsylvania senior senator, Bob Casey, has gone from being a major centrist to much more a progressive, the junior senator Fetterman is now being perceived as going from a progressive to a much more independent centrist.”\nMr. Fetterman is proud that he acknowledged his depression publicly: “I realize now that addressing mental health is really critical because I’ve had a lot of people reach out to me and thank me for talking about it, and they have their own personal issue,” he says. “I’ve never been afraid of being judged. My only interest is really trying to help people—because I got lucky and I was able to get the kind of help that I needed. I want that kind of help for anybody—I don’t care, Republican, Democrat, anyone.”\nIf there is any stress in having the progressive and socialist wing of his party angry at him, it doesn’t show. Mr. Fetterman looks as healthy as he did when he ran for lieutenant governor in 2017—when he was first diagnosed with an irregular heart rhythm, a diagnosis he later admitted he failed to address, and his doctor said ultimately led to his stroke.\n“Honestly, I feel fantastic,” he says. “That’s the truth.”\nMs. Zito is a reporter for the Washington Examiner and a co-author of “The Great Revolt: Inside the Populist Coalition Reshaping American Politics.”\nAdvertisement\nJournal Editorial Report: Best guesses of what's to come from Kim Strassel, Bill McGurn and Dan Henninger.

The union complained that U.S. Steel blindsided it by giving no advance notice of the deal. Perhaps management can right that misstep by apologizing publicly. The American steel industry is operating at about 75.4% of capacity and idle capacity exceeds U.S. Steel’s total output, so there is no danger of monopolistic behavior by the merged firm.

PHOTO: MAYA ALLERUZZO/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nOn Christmas Day, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced that U.S. military forces conducted “proportionate” strikes against Iraqi militias that attacked and wounded American service members (“Biden Endangers U.S. Troops,” Review & Outlook, Dec. 27). The statement defines the equivocating, timid and wholly unsuccessful strategy of the Biden administration, but also of successive administrations for years.\nAfter nearly daily attacks on U.S. forces over months, resulting in dozens of wounded Americans, “proportionate” ought to have been revealed as having no deterrent value. It is past time for the U.S. to signal to those who attack our forces that they will pay disproportionately and severely. Continued attacks will see increasingly robust spankings. In this case, if the Iraqi government won’t support our actions, remove our troops. Rope-a-dope tactics fail our men and women who serve.\nLt. Gen. G.S. Newbold, USMC (Ret.)\nFlat Rock, N.C.\nWhat is the point of having the most powerful and technologically sophisticated armed forces in the world if they are kept on the sidelines even when they are under attack? Why continue to spend hundreds of billions of dollars for a U.S. military that is ordered to do no more than the bare minimum as American soldiers and shipping are under siege?\nPresident Biden’s actions have all but openly renounced the use of decisive military force against hostile powers, and the present chaos shows that Iran and her vassals have gotten the message. Until we re-establish a credible deterrent and demonstrate to the world that we possess the will to use the lethal arms at our disposal, the open season on American interests will continue unabated.\nAdam Robbins\nPrinceton, N.J.\nYour editorial poses the question: “When will President Biden do his duty as Commander in Chief and protect Americans deployed abroad?” I couldn’t help but wonder when he would do his duty as president to protect citizens at home from mass illegal immigration. He appears unwilling to do either.\nJesse Armstrong\nMidlothian, Va.\nThe highest priority of our military is to protect the nation against our enemies and to advance our national interests when peaceful means have failed. Fear of a larger conflict isn’t a policy: You avoid escalation either through convincing deterrence or by pre-emptive surrender—and clearly we have passed on convincing deterrence.\nStanley Spatz\nAdvertisement\nHollywood, Fla.\nAppeared in the January 2, 2024, print edition as 'Biden’s ‘Proportionate’ Defense of U.S. Troops'.\nSHOW CONVERSATION (133)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nMarine Le Pen Found Guilty of Embezzlement, Banned From Next Election\nIf Vaccines Don’t Cause Autism, What Does?\nMike Waltz Is Losing Support Inside the White House\nNo More Mr. Nice Guy.

         "133 3 min. Defense. Secretary. Lloyd. Austin speaks in. Tel. Aviv,. Dec. 18. On. Christmas. Day,. Defense. Secretary. Lloyd. Austin announced that. U.S. military forces conducted \"proportionate\" strikes against. Iraqi militias that attacked and wounded. American service members \"Biden. Endangers. U.S. Troops,\". Review. Outlook,. Dec. 27. The statement defines the equivocating, timid and wholly unsuccessful strategy of the. Biden administration, but also of successive administrations for years. After nearly daily attacks on. U.S. forces over months, resulting in dozens of wounded. Americans, \"proportionate\" ought to have been revealed as having no deterrent value. It is past time for the. U.S. to signal to those who attack our forces that they will pay disproportionately and severely. Continued attacks will see increasingly robust spankings. In this case, if the. Iraqi government won't support our actions, remove our troops. Rope-a-dope tactics fail our men and women who serve. What is the point of having the most powerful and technologically sophisticated armed forces in the world if they are kept on the sidelines even when they are under attack? Why continue to spend hundreds of billions of dollars for a. U.S. military that is ordered to do no more than the bare minimum as. American soldiers and shipping are under siege? President. Biden's actions have all but openly renounced the use of decisive military force against hostile powers, and the present chaos shows that. Iran and her vassals have gotten the message. Until we re-establish a credible deterrent and demonstrate to the world that we possess the will to use the lethal arms at our disposal, the open season on. American interests will continue unabated. Princeton,. N.J. Your editorial poses the question \"When will. President. Biden do his duty as. Commander in. Chief and protect. Americans deployed abroad?\". I couldn't help but wonder when he would do his duty as president to protect citizens at home from mass illegal immigration. He appears unwilling to do either. Midlothian,. Va. The highest priority of our military is to protect the nation against our enemies and to advance our national interests when peaceful means have failed. Fear of a larger conflict isn't a policy. You avoid escalation either through convincing deterrence or by pre-emptive surrenderand clearly we have passed on convincing deterrence. No. More. Mr. Nice. Guy. In. Fighting. Trump,. Canada.

         "Title: Minnesota Nice Wants Minnesota Ice: Locals Crave Bone-Chilling Normal\n\nU.S.\nA-HED\nMinnesota Nice Wants Minnesota Ice: Locals Crave Bone-Chilling Normal\n‘Maybe we’ll get lucky and have a polar vortex.’ Unusually mild weather has shaken up seasonal routines, though golfing in winter isn’t bad.\nCrews use specialized vehicles to move man-made snow over trails at the Battle Creek Regional Park in St. Paul, Minn. ROB ADAMS\nBy\nMelanie Evans\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 1, 2024 10:23 am ET\n151\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(8 min)\nFor Minnesotan Tara Young, the perfect beach conditions are when the water is, well, extra stimulating. She prefers the middle of winter, when most mornings she treks off to soak in a nearby frigid lake.\nThe 38-year-old enjoys her chilly pastime so much she volunteers to clear and maintain an opening to the water through inches of ice, so bathers may plunge. \n“I love the sawing and the clearing,” says Young, a mom and retail worker. “It warms you up a bit before you get in.” \nThat hasn’t been needed lately. There was thin or no ice on many Minnesota lakes in December, and the state’s average temperature for the month appears to be the warmest on record. One can hope this all turns around soon.\n“Maybe we’ll get lucky and have a polar vortex,” says Young, referring to a weather pattern that can draw arctic air from the North Pole.\nThat is not a sentiment uttered in most of the U.S., but Minnesotans have an unusually close kinship with winter. For them, it is a season to escape, endure or embrace. The embracers go big. Towns compete for the title of the state’s coldest spot, thrillseekers surf the big waves off Duluth, and bars pop up in the middle of frozen lakes to cater to ice fishermen. \nNow, relatively balmy temperatures and scarce snow have upended life as Minnesotans know it, disrupting routines, canceling wintry events and leaving many anxiously hoping for a return to bone-chilling normal. \n“Pray for cold weather so we can go fishing!” wrote Garrison Sports Bait & Tackle in a post on its Facebook page.\nThe shop on Mille Lacs Lake is about 100 miles north of Minneapolis, not normally a region where the locals need divine intervention to make ice in the winter.\nIn colder years, owners Ashley Schmaltz and her husband, Wayne Schmaltz, use a heavy-duty diesel truck to plow snow from the ice for fishing. As many as 200 ice houses might dot the lake along their property.\nAs of Saturday morning, Schmaltz could see open water. Her family’s portable ice house remains folded in their backyard, and everybody she knows is itching to get out ice fishing. “People are bored.”\nThe local economy also counts on wintertime tourism, so on Facebook Garrison Sports Bait & Tackle is urging anglers who typically take their boats off the water in late fall, to put them back in. “Word is the bite is awesome. We are still offering 20% off bait until the lake freezes!”\nDecember ended with a brief light snow in the Twin Cities, and while things were trending colder, the National Weather Service was forecasting above-normal low temperatures for the start of the year.\nThe unusual season is, in part, because air currents that deliver freezing temperatures to the state have shifted north this year with the El Niño weather system, a natural warming condition in the Pacific Ocean. Climate change has also contributed, says Pete Boulay, a climatologist with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. \nMinnesota’s lack of snow is compounding the problem, since snow reflects solar radiation, Boulay says. Maps updated weekly show snow cover in a pocket of northwestern counties disappearing. The rest of Minnesota is largely bare. \n“Having no snow on the ground is a big factor,” Boulay says. It is also eerie in a state where blizzards can strike as early as Halloween. One epic 1940 storm stranded hunters who froze to death. Heavy snowfall in 2010 accumulated on the inflated covering of the Minnesota Vikings stadium, which couldn’t bear the weight.

The 38-year-old enjoys her chilly pastime so much she volunteers to clear and maintain an opening to the water through inches of ice, so bathers may plunge. \"I love the sawing and the clearing,\" says. Young, a mom and retail worker. \"It warms you up a bit before you get in.\". That hasn't been needed lately. There was thin or no ice on many. Minnesota lakes in. December, and the state's average temperature for the month appears to be the warmest on record. One can hope this all turns around soon. \"Maybe we'll get lucky and have a polar vortex,\" says. Young, referring to a weather pattern that can draw arctic air from the. North. Pole. That is not a sentiment uttered in most of the. U.S., but. Minnesotans have an unusually close kinship with winter. For them, it is a season to escape, endure or embrace. The embracers go big. Towns compete for the title of the state's coldest spot, thrillseekers surf the big waves off. Duluth, and bars pop up in the middle of frozen lakes to cater to ice fishermen. Now, relatively balmy temperatures and scarce snow have upended life as. Minnesotans know it, disrupting routines, canceling wintry events and leaving many anxiously hoping for a return to bone-chilling normal. \"Pray for cold weather so we can go fishing!\" wrote.

December ended with a brief light snow in the. Twin. Cities, and while things were trending colder, the. National. Weather. Service was forecasting above-normal low temperatures for the start of the year. The unusual season is, in part, because air currents that deliver freezing temperatures to the state have shifted north this year with the. El. Nio weather system, a natural warming condition in the. Pacific. Ocean. Climate change has also contributed, says. Pete. Boulay, a climatologist with the. Minnesota. Department of. Natural. Resources.

The FTC brought the case in December 2020, during the final weeks of the Trump administration.\nThe FTC, which shares responsibility for enforcing antitrust laws with the Justice Department, alleges Meta, formerly known as Facebook, unlawfully sought to suppress competition by buying up potential rivals such as the messaging platform WhatsApp and image-sharing app Instagram. Meta has said those were procompetitive deals that benefited consumers.\nThe case has moved slowly. In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the complaint originally filed under the Trump administration, saying the FTC hadn’t sufficiently backed up its allegation that Meta has monopoly power. After the agency beefed up and refiled the case, the judge said the agency could begin deposing witnesses.\nBut when the FTC in December asked Boasberg to push the litigation forward, Meta’s lawyers countered that the case is “nowhere near trial.”\n“After delaying nearly a decade to challenge historical acquisitions that the agency reviewed in 2012 and 2014, the FTC has no basis to claim that this case is now urgent,” Meta’s lawyers said.\nWhile the case predates FTC Chair Lina Khan’s tenure, it will help define her legacy. Both before and since she took the post in 2021, Khan has argued in favor of blocking more deals, aggressively attacking monopolistic practices and potentially breaking up some of America’s largest companies, particularly in Big Tech.\nMeta has said Khan is biased, and sought to block her involvement in a different FTC case relating to Meta’s acquisition of the virtual-reality firm Within Unlimited. In that case, a federal judge denied the FTC’s request for an injunction halting the acquisition.  \nThat decision, while a setback for the FTC, included some legal analysis that could help the agency bring similar cases involving nascent markets.\nKhan enters 2024 with a mixed record in court fights. In July, a federal judge ruled against the FTC and allowed Microsoft to go ahead with its $75 billion purchase of videogaming company Activision Blizzard.\nBut in December, a federal appeals court agreed with the FTC that Illumina’s purchase of cancer-test developer Grail was anticompetitive, prompting the San Diego-based company to pursue what its CEO called an “expeditious divestiture” of Grail by the middle of 2024. And on the last business day of 2023, a judge blocked healthcare data provider IQVIA from buying the owner of pharmaceutical ad-technology company DeepIntent, agreeing with the FTC that there was “a reasonable probability that the proposed acquisition will substantially impair competition in the relevant market.”\nThose rulings don’t mean that Khan and Kanter will succeed in persuading more courts to buy in this year to their broader take on antitrust law. “It’s going to be a marathon, not a sprint,” Vanderbilt’s Allensworth said.\nWrite to Jan Wolfe at jan.wolfe@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 4, 2024, print edition as 'Big Tech Braces for Rulings This Year in Antitrust Cases'.\nSHOW CONVERSATION (48)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nMarine Le Pen Found Guilty of Embezzlement, Banned From Next Election\nIf Vaccines Don’t Cause Autism, What Does?\nMike Waltz Is Losing Support Inside the White House\nNo More Mr. Nice Guy.

         "Title: The Sports-Betting Traders Deciding How Much You Win or Lose\n\nThe Sports-Betting Traders Deciding How Much You Win or Lose\nOn an NFL Sunday, oddsmakers juggle athletic drama on the field and the financial stakes behind it\nTraders work at the FanDuel office during Sunday-football events in Jersey City, N.J.\nBy\nKatherine Sayre\nFollow\n| Photography by Gabby Jones for The Wall Street Journal\nJan. 1, 2024 7:01 am ET\n141\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(7 min)\nJERSEY CITY, N.J.—Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill recently marked a 78-yard touchdown with an unusual celebration. He and teammates imitated riding a roller coaster, sitting on the field with their arms waving overhead.\nMore than 200 miles away, sports-betting company FanDuel’s sports-trading desk was riding its own waves that Sunday afternoon. The traders on duty—self-professed sports buffs with a knack for math—were trying to predict how National Football League athletes and teams would perform that day. \nSports-trading desks are similar to financial-trading desks on Wall Street, which enable investors to buy and sell stocks and bonds. However, the sports desks create odds to influence and entice bets in a live market where hundreds of millions of dollars are exchanged on American athletic events.\nThe Miami Dolphins celebrate a touchdown. PHOTO: GEOFF BURKE/USA TODAY SPORTS/REUTERS\nHill’s seconds-long run into the endzone meant a $68,000 hit to the sportsbook on customer bets on whether he would score the first touchdown of the game. Immediately, bettors’ money started rolling in on Hill to score more touchdowns and gain more yards.\nThe Dolphins ended up trouncing the Washington Commanders 45-15. FanDuel lost $1 million on the game.\n“You have good days, bad days,” said Will Twinn, a lead FanDuel sports trader that day. “It’s really about getting the prices right and let the cards fall where they may.”\nSports betting has become big business for gambling companies, sports leagues and media outlets over the past five years. By the time your finger taps the glass of a smartphone screen to place a bet, a sportsbook trading desk powered by algorithms and raw data on past and current games has made its best guess of what is likely to play out on the field.\nFanDuel’s algorithm simulates each play of a football game 10,000 times to try to predict the outcome, who might score a touchdown or how many yards a wide receiver might get.\nWhile financial markets typically operate within set trading windows, sportsbooks add new markets—additional betting offerings—around the clock. If a trader needs to step away for a quick break, another steps in.\nOn the recent Sunday, FanDuel took in more than $200 million bets on NFL games. That figure is the total amount customers placed in bets that day, before winnings were paid out.\nAs one FanDuel trader rushed to shift the Dolphins’ odds after Hill’s touchdown, another monitored the New England Patriots’ matchup with the Los Angeles Chargers.

Join the conversation below.\nSpencer Diaz, in his second NFL season as a FanDuel trader, sat in front of a half-dozen screens at his desk. One featured a high-speed video stream from the NFL of his assigned game, the Dolphins against the Commanders. Another showed a grid of odds from other sportsbooks for a view of the market trends. A third displayed FanDuel’s automated system, where traders can compare the FanDuel’s modeling with what is playing out on the field.\nDiaz, a lifelong sports fan, picked working at FanDuel over going to law school. He said taking over responsibility for a game was, at first, “a bit nerve-wracking seeing all the money coming in.”\nThe Dolphins were favored to win at kickoff by 8.5 points, which shifted to 17 points as the game progressed. After Hill scored another touchdown, FanDuel decided the odds favored Miami to have a more decisive win, by a margin of about 22 points.\nEd Miller, who co-founded a company that automates sportsbook pricing for gambling companies, said the modern sportsbook is a far cry from Las Vegas-style sports betting in which human bookmakers made the calculations and you might find a white board with a game’s odds written on it.\nFanDuel, which is going head-to-head with DraftKings for the No. 1 position in the sports-betting market, asserted its dominance with help of a now-ubiquitous product: the single-game parlay. A bettor can string together several bets on one game, including how specific players will perform.\nThe chances of winning—that each leg of the parlay will, in fact, happen in the game—lean heavily in favor of the house. The appeal of a big cashout, though, has maintained its popularity.\nFor example, when the Baltimore Ravens played the Jacksonville Jaguars on Dec. 17, FanDuel offered a seven-leg parlay on how five star players would perform in passing yards, receiving yards, rushing yards and touchdowns. A $10 wager would win $457.

Rubin\nFollow\nJan. 1, 2024 5:31 am ET\n48\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(5 min)\nThe labor market has cooled, but as of November, it was still producing jobs at a faster pace than it was just before the pandemic. PHOTO: ERIC THAYER/BLOOMBERG NEWS\nEmployers slowed hiring and handed out smaller raises in recent months, signs of fading momentum in the job market that have some forecasters expecting unemployment to rise in 2024.\nAnd that might be OK. The key for American workers and Federal Reserve policymakers is to have the labor market cool without collapsing. That would support household incomes while helping inflation drift lower, putting the economy on a glide path to a soft landing—as long as the slowdown isn’t too severe.\n“You can see these small cracks forming” in the labor market, said Michael Pugliese, a senior economist at Wells Fargo. “That should give you reason for pause going into 2024.” \nHere is where the labor market is heading in the new year.\nCooling trend\nThe U.S. labor market was a pillar of economic strength in 2023, with solid hiring and rising wages helping households navigate high inflation and an otherwise bleak view of the economy. It was also too hot for the Fed. Officials at the central bank worried that high demand for goods and services alongside a constrained supply of workers would push wages up too fast, fueling inflation.\nSeveral factors combined to cool it off—to the point that economists expect hiring to slow considerably in 2024.\nThe Fed’s campaign of interest-rate hikes made it more expensive to borrow money, slowing some economic activity. Many industries that had struggled to find workers surpassed prepandemic employment levels, making hiring less urgent. People came off the sidelines and immigration picked up, adding to the pool of available workers.\nBy the end of 2023, workers had stopped job hopping as much, while employers hired less but kept layoffs low. The result was a less-frenzied labor market.\nConcentrated hiring\nJob growth also became more concentrated in a handful of industries: healthcare and social assistance (which includes private-sector child-care workers, home-care aides and social workers), leisure and hospitality, as well as state and local government.

         "Gabriel. T. Rubin. Jan. 1, 531 am. ET 48 5 min. The labor market has cooled, but as of. November, it was still producing jobs at a faster pace than it was just before the pandemic. Employers slowed hiring and handed out smaller raises in recent months, signs of fading momentum in the job market that have some forecasters expecting unemployment to rise in . And that might be. OK. The key for. American workers and. Federal. Reserve policymakers is to have the labor market cool without collapsing. That would support household incomes while helping inflation drift lower, putting the economy on a glide path to a soft landingas long as the slowdown isn't too severe. \"You can see these small cracks forming\" in the labor market, said. Michael. Pugliese, a senior economist at. Wells. Fargo. \"That should give you reason for pause going into .\". Here is where the labor market is heading in the new year. The. U.S. labor market was a pillar of economic strength in , with solid hiring and rising wages helping households navigate high inflation and an otherwise bleak view of the economy. It was also too hot for the. Fed. Officials at the central bank worried that high demand for goods and services alongside a constrained supply of workers would push wages up too fast, fueling inflation. Several factors combined to cool it offto the point that economists expect hiring to slow considerably in . The. Fed's campaign of interest-rate hikes made it more expensive to borrow money, slowing some economic activity. Many industries that had struggled to find workers surpassed prepandemic employment levels, making hiring less urgent. People came off the sidelines and immigration picked up, adding to the pool of available workers. of , workers had stopped job hopping as much, while employers hired less but kept layoffs low. The result was a less-frenzied labor market. Job growth also became more concentrated in a handful of industries healthcare and social assistance which includes private-sector child-care workers, home-care aides and social workers, leisure and hospitality, as well as state and local government. Outside those sectors, hiring slowed sharply and in some areas contracted. The less dynamic labor market helped put a brake on rapid wage growtha key consideration for the. Fed.

Stocks rose through much of 2023, powered by the rise of artificial intelligence and an economy that stayed stronger than nearly all of Wall Street had anticipated. The recession that investors had largely agreed was imminent never came.\nNow, with the S&P 500 within 0.6% of a record high, the crowd is much more optimistic.\nBehind the dramatic turn in attitude is a growing belief among investors that the Federal Reserve’s campaign to fight inflation is winding down, ending the interest-rate hikes that buffeted markets in recent years. Many now expect the central bank will likely next cut rates instead, shifting market dynamics in ways that seemed unlikely just months ago.\nWSJ'S TAKE ON THE WEEK\nTake On the Year: What to Expect in Markets and Money in 2024\n18:42\n1x\nSUBSCRIBE\nAdd to Queue\nExplore Audio Center\nObvious risks are on the horizon: A sharp fall in rates could follow bad news, like an economic shock or recession. The few big stocks that powered the market higher last year could run out of steam. Looming elections in the U.S., and wars in Europe and the Middle East, might make the world less investor friendly.\nBut 2023’s big gains, and the prospect of even smoother seas ahead, have helped dissipate much of the gloom. \n“Instead of a higher for longer rate environment, it’s lower and sooner,“ said David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. Goldman has an S&P 500 target of 5100, implying a return of about 7% from current levels near 4770. Strategists at JPMorgan Chase are among the bears, with a price target of 4200.\nThe year culminated with a fierce “everything rally” that pushed prices higher in nearly every asset class, including stocks, bonds, gold and even cryptocurrencies. Yields on risky corporate bonds have fallen to some of the lowest levels of the past year, while bond prices have rallied.\nAll told, the S&P 500 returned 24%. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield settled at 3.860%, near where it started the year, but down from a peak of 5.021% in October. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, closed Friday at 12.52, near several-year lows.\nMost investors are expecting the good times to continue.\nA survey conducted in December by BofA Securities found that fund managers were more optimistic than in any month since January 2022, which coincides with the S&P 500’s last all-time high. The group is collectively the most bullish on stocks since February 2022.\nMore than 90% of participants, who collectively manage $691 billion of assets, predicted the Fed is done raising interest rates. More than 60% said they expect lower bond yields in a year, a record high for the survey. \n“Even with moves we’ve had recently, you still have generationally attractive fixed-income markets,” said Matt Orton, head of market strategy at Raymond James Investment Management.\nHe said corporate bonds look especially attractive, offering investors the best opportunity since the financial crisis of 2008-09 to diversify their portfolios and lock in higher rates longer term.\nEarnings could also provide a boost, after they stagnated last year. Wall Street is expecting a return to brisk growth in corporate profits, with analysts forecasting S&P 500 earnings growth of 11.6% in the new year and 12.5% in 2025, according to FactSet.\nWhile investors love bonds and stocks in general, some are more skeptical of the “Magnificent Seven” group of big technology companies that dominated the market in 2023. Nearly half of those survey respondents identified owning shares of those seven firms—Apple, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla—as the “most crowded” trade on Wall Street. \nThe average one-year price target for stocks within the Magnificent Seven is about 11% higher than Friday’s closing price, according to estimates compiled by FactSet. Nvidia has the highest expected return at about 34%. The laggard is Tesla; analysts are projecting the stock will shed 3%. \nMany consider that crowding a sign of limited future upside. \n“I certainly would not underweight them, but I’m not sure they will outperform the rest of the market. The other 493 stocks are in a catch-up trade,” said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust, referring to the rest of the S&P 500. \nAdvertisement\nRoth said several other sectors are attractively priced, including financials, healthcare and energy stocks.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat are your stock market predictions for 2024? Join the conversation below.\nUncertainty stemming from November’s presidential election—and the potential for major shifts in fiscal policy—also looms as a possible risk for markets, some strategists said. \nBut the S&P 500 has risen in 73.9% of presidential election years since 1929, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That is higher than the overall average of 64.9%. The index has returned an average of 6.15% in election years.\nThe major risk remains disappointment over interest rates. Fed officials released projections of at least three rate cuts in 2024 after their most recent policy meeting. Interest-rate derivatives traders are betting on more—projecting interest rates about 1.5 percentage points below current levels, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool. That implies six or seven cuts by the central bank, with most expecting the first at the March policy meeting.\nThat gap has some strategists predicting market swings if the Fed is slower to cut than investors expect.  \n“I just think there’s still going to be challenges with the market perhaps being ahead of where the Fed is.” said Raymond James’s Orton. “And that’s OK, because volatility presents opportunities.”\nNavigating the Markets\nCoverage and analysis, selected by editors\nGET WSJ'S MARKETS A.M.

Here is how Biden has fared on his major 2020 campaign proposals:\nHow many promises has Biden kept?\nKept\nStalled\nNot kept\nEach dot represents a promise\nTOPIC PROMISES\nEconomy\nImmigration\nForeign policy\nClimate\nCriminal justice and guns\n^ Select a topic to scroll down to that section\nThe promises\nInfrastructure Prescription drugs ‘Remain in Mexico’ Travel ban Afghanistan Global alliances Paris agreement Keystone XL pipeline Climate investments Nonviolent drug offenders Taxes Student loans Paid leave Child and elder care Minimum wage Pathway to citizenship Iran deal Assault-weapons ban Border wall Asylum limits Detention Offshore drilling Death penalty\n^ Select a promise to scroll down to it\nEconomy\nBiden campaigned on turning around an economy that had suffered during the pandemic, pledging government spending, repealing Trump-era tax cuts for the wealthy and lowering costs.\nPROMISE KEPT\nInfrastructure\nBiden signed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill into law in November 2021. Investing in infrastructure was a central part of Biden’s domestic policy agenda during the campaign.\nPROMISE KEPT\nPrescription drugs\nAs a candidate, Biden proposed repealing the law that bars Medicare from negotiating lower prices with drug corporations. Instead of repealing the law, Biden signed into law a measure that would allow the federal government to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs for some Medicare recipients.\nPROMISE STALLED\nTaxes\nBiden ran on reversing the parts of the 2017 tax law that benefited corporations and high-income households while expanding the child tax credit. He got partway there. The child-credit expansion was in place for 2021 before lapsing. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act created a new minimum tax on large corporations. But many of Biden’s other tax increases on high-income Americans ran into opposition in the Senate.\nPROMISE STALLED\nStudent loans\nBiden proposed canceling $10,000 of every federal borrower’s loans during the campaign. After facing pressure from progressives, Biden said in August 2022 he would cancel up to $20,000 for borrowers below a certain income threshold, but the Supreme Court overturned his plan. The administration has used other tools to cancel student debt. More than three million borrowers have had $132 billion of their federal student loans flagged for cancellation.\nPROMISE STALLED\nPaid leave\nBiden’s campaign proposal called for 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. He included it as part of his economic agenda in 2021, but it was ultimately taken out during congressional negotiations.\nPROMISE STALLED\nChild and elder care\nAs a candidate, Biden released a plan to spend $775 billion over 10 years on supporting child care and elder care and setting up universal prekindergarten. He released a proposal that included those aspects in 2021, but they were ultimately left out of the legislative priorities that were signed into law.\nPROMISE STALLED\nMinimum wage\nBiden called for increasing the federal minimum wage to $15, but the measure was taken out of his legislative proposals.\n^BACK TO TOP\nImmigration\nBiden bashed Trump’s hard-line immigration policies during the campaign and promised a different approach. So far in his first term, he has reversed some Trump policies, but the record surge in migrants crossing the southern border prompted him to adopt some of Trump’s measures.\nPROMISE KEPT\n‘Remain in Mexico’\nAfter a two-year court battle, the Biden administration ended in 2022 the program known as Remain in Mexico, which requires migrants seeking asylum to live in northern Mexican border cities during their U.S. court proceedings. The administration took longer to end the policy than immigration advocates had expected.\nPROMISE KEPT\nTravel ban\nBiden signed an executive order reversing a Trump-era travel ban from several largely Muslim and African countries on his first day in office.\nPROMISE STALLED\nPathway to citizenship\nBiden said he would work with Congress to pass an immigration bill that would include a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants in the country who lack a permanent legal status. Although the president released a proposal, Congress has largely ignored it.\nPROMISE NOT KEPT\nBorder wall\nDuring the campaign, Biden pledged that “not another foot” of border wall would be built in his administration. He issued an executive order halting all wall construction on his first day in office. But in October, the Department of Homeland Security outlined its intent to build up to 20 new miles of border barriers—of the kind used by the Trump administration—in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.\nPROMISE NOT KEPT\nAsylum limits\nBiden campaigned against Trump’s more restrictive asylum policies. But in January, he proposed a version of his predecessor’s asylum rule that would make migrants who move through another country on the way and don’t first apply for asylum in that country ineligible for asylum in the U.S.\nPROMISE NOT KEPT\nDetention\nBiden pledged to stop contracting with for-profit detention centers. Although he signed an executive order to end the use of private prisons, he did not issue a similar one for those held in the immigration detention system.\n^BACK TO TOP\nForeign policy\nBiden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, campaigned on ending wars and restoring U.S. alliances. Although he withdrew troops from Afghanistan, the U.S. is now helping fund two new conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.\nPROMISE KEPT\nAfghanistan\nBiden campaigned on ending the “forever wars,” and bringing most U.S. troops home from Afghanistan and the Middle East. The last American troops in Afghanistan left at the end of August 2021, marking the formal end of the longest war in U.S. history. Although the president kept his promise, the withdrawal was broadly seen as chaotic and included the death of 13 service members in an attack in Kabul.\nPROMISE KEPT\nGlobal alliances\nBiden said he would strengthen U.S. alliances, particularly with NATO. He has since rallied NATO countries against Russia’s war in Ukraine and helped expand the alliance to include Finland and Sweden.\nPROMISE STALLED\nIran deal\nBiden said as a candidate that he would return to the 2015 Iran nuclear accord, if Tehran also agreed to abide by it.

         "The. Campaign. Promises. That. Joe. Biden. Keptand the. Ones. He. Broke. The president followed through on boosting infrastructure spending and pulling out of. Afghanistan but didn't fully reverse. Trump's immigration policies. Jan. 1, 500 am. ET. RESPONSES. President. Biden is touting his domestic and foreign policy record as he contrasts his time in office with the tenure of his likely opponent, former. President. Donald. Trump. Although. Biden has had some bipartisan legislative victories, he has fallen short on some of his promises. Here is how. Biden has fared on his major campaign proposals. How many promises has. Biden kept? Select a topic to scroll down to that section. Infrastructure. Prescription drugs 'Remain in. Mexico'. Travel ban. Afghanistan. Global alliances. Paris agreement. Keystone. XL pipeline. Climate investments. Nonviolent drug offenders. Taxes. Student loans. Paid leave. Child and elder care. Minimum wage. Pathway to citizenship. Iran deal. Assault-weapons ban. Border wall. Asylum limits. Detention. Offshore drilling. Death penalty. Select a promise to scroll down to it. Biden campaigned on turning around an economy that had suffered during the pandemic, pledging government spending, repealing. Trump-era tax cuts for the wealthy and lowering costs. Biden signed a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill into law in. November . Investing in infrastructure was a central part of. Biden's domestic policy agenda during the campaign. As a candidate,. Biden proposed repealing the law that bars. Medicare from negotiating lower prices with drug corporations. Instead of repealing the law,. Biden signed into law a measure that would allow the federal government to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs for some. Medicare recipients. Biden ran on reversing the parts of the tax law that benefited corporations and high-income households while expanding the child tax credit. He got partway there. The child-credit expansion was in place for before lapsing. The. Inflation. Reduction. Act created a new minimum tax on large corporations. But many of. Biden's other tax increases on high-income. Americans ran into opposition in the. Senate. Biden proposed canceling 10,000 of every federal borrower's loans during the campaign. After facing pressure from progressives,. Biden said in. August he would cancel up to 20,000 for borrowers below a certain income threshold, but the. Supreme. Court overturned his plan. The administration has used other tools to cancel student debt. More than three million borrowers have had 132 billion of their federal student loans flagged for cancellation. Biden's campaign proposal called for 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. He included it as part of his economic agenda in , but it was ultimately taken out during congressional negotiations. As a candidate,. Biden released a plan to spend 775 billion over 10 years on supporting child care and elder care and setting up universal prekindergarten. He released a proposal that included those aspects in , but they were ultimately left out of the legislative priorities that were signed into law. Biden called for increasing the federal minimum wage to 15, but the measure was taken out of his legislative proposals. BACK. TO. TOP. Biden bashed. Trump's hard-line immigration policies during the campaign and promised a different approach. So far in his first term, he has reversed some. Trump policies, but the record surge in migrants crossing the southern border prompted him to adopt some of. Trump's measures. 'Remain in. Mexico'. After a two-year court battle, the. Biden administration ended in the program known as. Remain in. Mexico, which requires migrants seeking asylum to live in northern. Mexican border cities during their. U.S. court proceedings. The administration took longer to end the policy than immigration advocates had expected. Biden signed an executive order reversing a. Trump-era travel ban from several largely. Muslim and. African countries on his first day in office. Biden said he would work with. Congress to pass an immigration bill that would include a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants in the country who lack a permanent legal status. Although the president released a proposal,. Congress has largely ignored it. During the campaign,. Biden pledged that \"not another foot\" of border wall would be built in his administration. He issued an executive order halting all wall construction on his first day in office. But in. October, the. Department of. Homeland. Security outlined its intent to build up to 20 new miles of border barriersof the kind used administrationin the. Rio. Grande. Valley of. Texas. Biden campaigned against. Trump's more restrictive asylum policies. But in. January, he proposed a version of his predecessor's asylum rule that would make migrants who move through another country on the way and don't first apply for asylum in that country ineligible for asylum in the. U.S. Biden pledged to stop contracting with for-profit detention centers. Although he signed an executive order to end the use of private prisons, he did not issue a similar one for those held in the immigration detention system. BACK. TO. TOP. Biden, a former chairman of the. Senate. Foreign. Relations. Committee, campaigned on ending wars and restoring. U.S. alliances. Although he withdrew troops from. Afghanistan, the. U.S. is now helping fund two new conflicts in. Ukraine and. Gaza. Biden campaigned on ending the \"forever wars,\" and bringing most. U.S. troops home from. Afghanistan and the. Middle. East. The last. American troops in. Afghanistan left at the end of. August , marking the formal end of the longest war in. U.S. history. Although the president kept his promise, the withdrawal was broadly seen as chaotic and included the death of 13 service members in an attack in. Kabul. Biden said he would strengthen. U.S. alliances, particularly with. NATO. He has since rallied. NATO countries against. Russia's war in. Ukraine and helped expand the alliance to include. Finland and. Sweden. Biden said as a candidate that he would return to the. Iran nuclear accord, if. Tehran also agreed to abide by it. His administration has tried to renegotiate the deal, but has been so far unsuccessful. BACK. TO. TOP. Biden proposed the most aggressive climate agenda of any major presidential nominee and has followed through on elements of it, including the passage of a sweeping climate spending bill. Biden pledged to rejoin the. Paris climate accord to cut global greenhouse-gas emissions and followed through. On his first day in office,. Biden followed through on a campaign pledge and revoked a permit for. Keystone. XL, an expansion of an existing pipeline that carries. Canadian crude into the. U.S. Biden's campaign proposal called for 2 trillion in spending. In. August of , he signed the. Inflation. Reduction.

That includes three launches of its newest Hwasong-18 intercontinental ballistic missile, making major advances in diversifying an arsenal that has an expected range long enough to reach the U.S. mainland.\nWeapons experts say the solid-fuel ICBM can be deployed more quickly and with more stealth than prior variants. Kim also accomplished one of his top weapons objectives by successfully launching a homegrown spy satellite into orbit in November, following two botched attempts earlier in the year. \nAn image released by North Korea’s Korean Central News Agency in December shows Kim Jong Un inspecting an intercontinental ballistic missile at an undisclosed location in North Korea.

With Beijing and Moscow on its side, Pyongyang has little incentive to halt its weapons program, and the stalled nuclear talks with Washington will allow North Korea to accelerate its military buildup, Kim regime watchers say. \nIn an undated photo provided by the North Korean government in December, Kim Jong Un, his daughter and an official watched what it said was an intercontinental ballistic missile launch in the country.

In August, he ordered increased production of artillery shells for front-line units as he oversaw the making of tactical missiles and mobile launch platforms at military factories. \nIn December, the United Nations nuclear watchdog said a new reactor appeared to be operating for the first time at North Korea’s Yongbyon nuclear complex, potentially signaling an additional source of plutonium for nuclear weapons. The discharge of warm water from a light water reactor suggested it was coming online, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. \nAdvertisement\nKim exchanged New Year’s greetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, vowing to further deepen bilateral ties. Xi said China-North Korea relations have entered a “new historic period” and that the two countries maintained close strategic communication and cooperation in international issues, according to North Korean state media. \nIn 2023, North Korea’s trade with China, its largest economic partner, reached a four-year high as bilateral trade recovered. Pyongyang has been gradually emerging from pandemic isolation, sending its athletes to the Asian Games in China and reviving high-level talks with China and Russia. \nA Chinese tourist eyed the North Korean border on the Yalu River at the Chinese border town of Dandong in September.

In a sign of the two countries’ warmer ties, Kim made his first overseas trip since the Covid-19 pandemic in September to meet Vladimir Putin in Russia’s Far East. The two pledged to cooperate closely on economic and military issues.\nAt the North Korean plenary session, Kim said he no longer considered South Korea as a counterpart for reconciliation and unification. \nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who took office in May 2022, has maintained a hawkish stance toward the Kim regime, focusing his efforts on strengthening trilateral cooperation with the U.S. and Japan to counter Pyongyang’s nuclear threats. In a New Year’s Day speech, Yoon said South Korea would build peace through strength, by advancing the country’s defense system to deter North Korean threats. \n“It will not be a submissive peace that is dependent on the goodwill of the adversary,” he said on Monday.\nWrite to Dasl Yoon at dasl.yoon@wsj.com and Timothy W.

         "Title: China’s Xi Is Resurrecting Mao’s ‘Continuous Revolution’ With a Twist\n\nChina’s Xi Is Resurrecting Mao’s ‘Continuous Revolution’ With a Twist\nThe Chinese leader has made his corruption purge—with millions punished—a pillar of his rule. It risks paralyzing his party.\nChinese leader Xi Jinping recently met with senior officers of the armed forces stationed in Nanning, southern China. LI GANG/XINHUA/ZUMA PRESS\nBy Chun Han WongFollow\nUpdated Jan. 1, 2024 12:08 am ET\nSAVE\nSHARE\nTEXT\n386 RESPONSES\nListen to article\nLength\n(10 minutes)\nQueue\nExplore Audio Center\nChinese rulers have long used campaigns against corruption to sideline rivals and consolidate power. Xi Jinping is increasingly tying his authority to a new variation: a purge that never ends.\nWith echoes of Mao Zedong’s “continuous revolution,” Xi has sent fear rippling through the ranks of the Communist Party for more than a decade with the largest campaign against corruption in modern Chinese history. It is now threatening to petrify the party as it tries to steer the world’s second-largest economy through its greatest period of uncertainty in a generation.\nSince he came to power in 2012, party enforcers have punished roughly five million people for offenses as serious as abuse of power and as innocuous as creating excessive red tape.\nIn 2023 alone, the unrelenting campaign swept through the worlds of finance, food, healthcare, semiconductors and sports—taking down scores of senior officials, bankers, hospital directors and even soccer administrators. China’s foreign and defense ministers went missing in the summer before being abruptly removed from their posts, leading to suspicions that they, too, have been purged. Beijing’s recent ouster of a dozen senior military and defense-industry officials from the national legislature and a government advisory body have fueled speculation about a broader shake-up of the country’s military establishment.\nLi Shangfu hasn’t made a public appearance since late August and U.S. officials say the Chinese Defense Minister is being ousted from his post. Li is the latest of several senior Chinese officials to disappear without explanation. Photo: How Hwee Young/Shutterstock\nThere is no end in sight. The Chinese leader recently outlined his plans for how the campaign would proceed in the next few years and has even targeted the very agency tasked with carrying it out.\nCritics of Xi say the campaign’s extension into a second decade is a result of his refusal to accept structural changes and greater transparency that are necessary for cleaner governance. \nAn anticorruption campaign in China is extending into a second decade as its economy, the world’s second largest, faces several challenges. PHOTO: NG HAN GUAN/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe Chinese leader has instead cast the blame on the moral failings of individuals, while doubling down on his centralized and opaque style of governance, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Xi’s remarks, party directives and official data. Only a continual cleansing can ensure the party remains potent and pure, he has argued.\n“Battling corruption is the most thorough form of self-revolution,” Xi said days before starting his third term as party chief in October 2022. “As long as the soil and conditions conducive for corruption continue to exist, the fight against corruption can’t cease for a moment.”\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWSJ China\nExclusive insights on the contest between the U.S. and China, brought to you by the WSJ’s top China correspondent.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nSuch an assertion clears the way for Xi to use disciplinary purges indefinitely as a way to enforce fealty, through fear, to himself and his vision.\n“In China, campaigns are supposed to be an intense but short burst of enforcement,” said Yuen Yuen Ang, a political-science professor at Johns Hopkins University. “Xi has invented a paradoxical policy tool: a perpetual campaign.”\nWhile the forever purge buttresses Xi’s authority, it also has instilled a constant apprehension and reluctance to act decisively among party members as challenges mount. The economy is struggling to shake its Covid hangover. Youth unemployment has skyrocketed, and the property market and consumer sentiment have tanked. Meanwhile, debt is piling up and foreign investors are increasingly turning their backs on the Chinese market.\nAdvertisement\nIn the early years of the campaign, many officials saw it as a longer and more ambitious version of previous efforts. Roughly 180,000 people were disciplined for infractions in 2013, a number that climbed to some 621,000 in 2018, the year Xi proclaimed a “crushing victory” over corruption.\nOfficial data show at least half a million people being disciplined every year since 2017—around four times as many as were typically punished annually when Xi’s predecessor held power from 2002 to 2012. \nBy some measures, corruption has indeed fallen under Xi.

         "China's. Xi. Is. Resurrecting. Mao's 'Continuous. Revolution'. With a. Twist. The. Chinese leader has made his corruption purgewith millions punisheda pillar of his rule. It risks paralyzing his party. Chinese leader. Xi. Jinping recently met with senior officers of the armed forces stationed in. Nanning, southern. China. LI. GANGXINHUAZUMA. PRESS 10 minutes. Chinese rulers have long used campaigns against corruption to sideline rivals and consolidate power. Xi. Jinping is increasingly tying his authority to a new variation a purge that never ends. With echoes of. Mao. Zedong's \"continuous revolution,\". Xi has sent fear rippling through the ranks of the. Communist. Party for more than a decade with the largest campaign against corruption in modern. Chinese history. It is now threatening to petrify the party as it tries to steer the world's second-largest economy through its greatest period of uncertainty in a generation. Since he came to power in , party enforcers have punished roughly five million people for offenses as serious as abuse of power and as innocuous as creating excessive red tape. In alone, the unrelenting campaign swept through the worlds of finance, food, healthcare, semiconductors and sportstaking down scores of senior officials, bankers, hospital directors and even soccer administrators. China's foreign and defense ministers went missing in the summer before being abruptly removed from their posts, leading to suspicions that they, too, have been purged. Beijing's recent ouster of a dozen senior military and defense-industry officials from the national legislature and a government advisory body have fueled speculation about a broader shake-up of the country's military establishment. Li. Shangfu hasn't made a public appearance since late. August and. U.S. officials say the. Chinese. Defense. Minister is being ousted from his post. Li is the latest of several senior. Chinese officials to disappear without explanation. There is no end in sight. The. Chinese leader recently outlined his plans for how the campaign would proceed in the next few years and has even targeted the very agency tasked with carrying it out. Critics of. Xi say the campaign's extension into a second decade is a result of his refusal to accept structural changes and greater transparency that are necessary for cleaner governance. An anticorruption campaign in. China is extending into a second decade as its economy, the world's second largest, faces several challenges. The. Chinese leader has instead cast the blame on the moral failings of individuals, while doubling down on his centralized and opaque style of governance, according to a. Wall. Street. Journal analysis of. Xi's remarks, party directives and official data. Only a continual cleansing can ensure the party remains potent and pure, he has argued. \"Battling corruption is the most thorough form of self-revolution,\". Xi said days before starting his third term as party chief in. October . \"As long as the soil and conditions conducive for corruption continue to exist, the fight against corruption can't cease for a moment.\". NEWSLETTER. SIGN-UP. Exclusive insights on the contest between the. U.S. and. China, brought to you 's top. China correspondent. Such an assertion clears the way for. Xi to use disciplinary purges indefinitely as a way to enforce fealty, through fear, to himself and his vision. \"In. China, campaigns are supposed to be an intense but short burst of enforcement,\" said. Yuen. Yuen. Ang, a political-science professor at. Johns. Hopkins. University. \"Xi has invented a paradoxical policy tool a perpetual campaign.\". While the forever purge buttresses. Xi's authority, it also has instilled a constant apprehension and reluctance to act decisively among party members as challenges mount. The economy is struggling to shake its. Covid hangover. Youth unemployment has skyrocketed, and the property market and consumer sentiment have tanked. Meanwhile, debt is piling up and foreign investors are increasingly turning their backs on the. Chinese market. In the early years of the campaign, many officials saw it as a longer and more ambitious version of previous efforts. Roughly 180,000 people were disciplined for infractions in , a number that climbed to some 621,000 in , the year. Xi proclaimed a \"crushing victory\" over corruption. Official data show at least half a million people being disciplined every year since around four times as many as were typically punished annually when. Xi's predecessor held power from to . , corruption has indeed fallen under. Xi. Berlin-based advocacy group. Transparency. International ranked. China 65th in its index on perceptions of public-sector corruption in 180 countries and territories, an improvement from 80th out of 176 jurisdictions in , the year. Xi took power. A survey published in 's. Ash. Center for. Democratic. Governance and. Innovation found that the proportion of. Chinese citizens who saw officials as being generally \"clean\" rose to more than 65 in from roughly 35 in . Xi.

The clock is ticking for their loved ones, they said, and Israel’s leaders need to do more to get them back.\nBen-Ezra, who had given up her job as a high-school administrator to fight for the return of her brother, 49-year-old software engineer Tsachi Idan, has been marking every day since his abduction.\n“It’s been 77 days. This has to end,” she said during the blockade on Dec. 22.\nFamilies of Israeli hostages, brought together by tragedy and a shared mission, have applied steady pressure on their government to make the return of captives its priority. Most relatives maintain that no Israeli offer to Hamas is too costly if it brings the hostages home. For nearly three months, they have carried out their campaign in the media, in protest gatherings and in meetings with decision makers in Israel and abroad. \nOn Thursday, representatives of 28 families met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who assured them he was doing all he could. President Biden hosted a smaller group in mid-December at the White House, where he told them U.S. efforts to bring everyone home wouldn’t cease. The White House at the time said that eight Americans remained captive inside Gaza. \nDowntown Tel Aviv, home of Israel’s military headquarters, has become a focal point for the campaign to bring hostages back from Gaza.\nHostage Square, in front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, draws crowds of supporters each week. PHOTO: OFIR BERMAN FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nHostage recovery has risen to the top of the Israeli government’s agenda because of the families, said Gideon Rahat, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n“If they were not there, maybe the goal of destroying Hamas would be No. 1, and this would be two or three,” he said.\nThe Netanyahu government must balance the pressure to recover the hostages with its declared goal of eradicating the threat of Hamas—an objective that also enjoys broad support in Israel following the Oct. 7 attack by the militant group on southern Israel. Furthering Israel’s challenge, militant groups other than Hamas are in control of some of the hostages.\nAdvertisement\nThe families concluded that their message to Israel’s leadership was getting through in November when Israel halted its assault on Gaza and set free Palestinian prisoners in a deal that led to the release of 105 of approximately 240 hostages.\nAfter that deal broke down, families kept up the pressure, and Israeli officials followed in December with an offer to Hamas to stop fighting for one week and allow more aid into Gaza in return for 40 more hostages. Hamas, a group the U.S. designates a terrorist organization, rejected the offer, in an effort to pressure Israel to offer more concessions. \nEgypt has since offered a full peace proposal—which Israel’s government has been giving serious attention because its first phase includes a hostage-prisoner exchange.\nWhen the war with Hamas began, Israeli families were initially grappling with the atrocities of the Oct. 7 attacks and struggling to find out the status of the missing. Israeli authorities eventually determined that around 1,200 people had been killed, most of them civilians.\nFamilies of hostages soon figured out they needed to band together. A group of Israeli lawyers, media strategists and former diplomats stepped up to help. The most immediate need, they determined, was a way for families to find each other and exchange information. They established a call center, which became a support group, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.\nAdvertisement\nDaniel Shek meets with the parents of abductee Omer Neutra at the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which has spread its campaign materials throughout Tel Aviv.\nAs Israel launched its assault in Gaza, Netanyahu quickly appointed a hostage coordinator. But it would take a week for the prime minister to meet with families whose relatives had been kidnapped.\nA collective effort by families to support each other and come up with ways to make their voices heard globally picked up. An Israeli tech businessman whose daughter was killed on Oct. 7 donated office space to the Families Forum, which attracted thousands of volunteers. \nWith the help of donations, the Forum spent several million dollars on advertisements on Google and Facebook, volunteers for the group said, and even bought screen time in New York’s Times Square. WhatsApp groups for the families started lighting up with updates on hostages and opportunities for relatives to appeal to media outlets and join delegations abroad. \nAdvertisement\nThe Forum has organized about 100 international trips for families to meet with officials in Europe and the U.S., as well as the World Health Organization and the United Nations, according to Daniel Shek, a former Israeli ambassador to France.\nShek got involved in the Forum early on, helping form a team of former diplomats and negotiators with experience in hostage situations. He said they have been able to float ideas to Israeli officials, while also contacting officials in the U.S., Europe and Egypt.\nA five-day walk in November from Tel Aviv to Netanyahu’s office in Jerusalem drew tens of thousands of supporters. Many families saw it as a turning point because a few days later, Israel struck the deal with Hamas to release dozens of women and children.\nThe families’ campaign can be seen throughout Tel Aviv, with posters identifying kidnapped Israelis on display on street corners and in the airport arrivals terminal. A plaza in front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art is now known as “Hostage Square,” with crowds, speeches and music every Saturday.\nAdvertisement\nAn empty dinner table set up in Hostage Square in Tel Aviv highlights the captives’ absence.\nEli Stivi, whose son was kidnapped by militants, says he wants Israel to resume talks to secure the release of more hostages.\nThe slogan “Bring Them Home Now” and paraphernalia such as yellow ribbons and black T-shirts featuring photos of hostages have helped attract supporters. Celebrities including Jerry Seinfeld have visited the plaza to show solidarity.\nThe families concede they have no influence over Hamas, which says Israel needs to implement a cease-fire before any hostage negotiations resume. Some relatives say Israel needs to do just that to bring Hamas to the table. Others have called on the government to bus thousands of Palestinian prisoners to the border with Gaza to make clear its willingness to pay for the release of its hostages.\nNetanyahu has said that unrelenting military pressure on Hamas is what will get the hostages back, and Israel has refused to pause fighting before negotiations.\nAdvertisement\nOn Dec. 15, the families were hit with another wave of anger and frustration when Israeli forces in Gaza mistakenly killed three Israeli hostages who had escaped.\nThat night, hundreds of relatives and supporters gathered outside the Kirya building—the Tel Aviv military headquarters, and where Israel’s cabinet meets on a regular basis. “I was screaming at them,” said Zohar Avigdori, who had welcomed two family members back from captivity in November. “If now is not the time to be mad, when is?”\nThe next day, the Families Forum helped set up about 20 tents outside the Kirya. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Benny Gantz, another member of Israel’s war cabinet, surprised families by coming to meet them at Hostage Square. Gantz offered assurances that Israel had the option to make a new offer to Hamas.\nOn Thursday, the Israeli military said it had determined that the killing of the three hostages was preventable and that it had shared its findings with soldiers to avoid another hostage tragedy.\nNetanyahu, meeting the families that day, tried to reassure them of Israel’s commitment to reaching a hostage deal. “We are holding contacts at this very moment,” he said, according to a statement about the meeting. “We are working to return them all. This is our goal.”\nAdvertisement\nAt the Kirya on a recent weekday, the families blocked the driveway at 29 minutes after each hour, to commemorate 6:29 a.m. on Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Israel. Their blockade lasted 241 seconds, representing the number of hostages taken into Gaza that day.\n“I came here because I want a new deal,” said Eli Stivi, whose son Idan was abducted in the attack on the Nova music festival. “I don’t want to stop the war, but I want to start the talks.”\nThe father, a tech entrepreneur, said he didn’t know whether his son was still alive. Of 129 hostages remaining in Gaza, 23 are dead, according to Israel.\nStivi said he thinks about whether Idan is cold, wherever he is. Stivi got into his white Mercedes to drive home for Shabbat dinner. He would return, he said, to sleep in a tent that night.\nWrite to Chao Deng at chao.deng@wsj.com\nConflict in the Middle East\nLatest news and key analysis, selected by editors\nChallenge to Hamas in Gaza Grows as Protests Enter Second Day\nPalestinian Film Director Released After Being Attacked by Israeli Settlers\nIsrael Is Killing Hamas Leaders in Quick Succession\nIn Gaza, Weddings Are Off and Restaurants Close Again as Cease-Fire Crumbles\nTurkey Detains Erdogan’s Top Rival in Raid on Opposition\nIsrael, Fighting Again in Gaza, Is Also at War at Home\nTrump’s Yemen Campaign Tests Promise to Avoid Forever Wars\nSyria to Integrate U.S.-Backed Kurdish Militia Into Armed Forces\nAdvertisement\nAppeared in the January 3, 2024, print edition as 'Families Band Together for Hostages'.",

Daniel. Shek, a former. Israeli ambassador to. France. Shek got involved in the. Forum early on, helping form a team of former diplomats and negotiators with experience in hostage situations. He said they have been able to float ideas to. Israeli officials, while also contacting officials in the. U.S.,. Europe and. Egypt. A five-day walk in. November from. Tel. Aviv to. Netanyahu's office in. Jerusalem drew tens of thousands of supporters. Many families saw it as a turning point because a few days later,. Israel struck the deal with. Hamas to release dozens of women and children. The families' campaign can be seen throughout. Tel. Aviv, with posters identifying kidnapped. Israelis on display on street corners and in the airport arrivals terminal. A plaza in front of the. Tel. Aviv. Museum of. Art is now known as \"Hostage. Square,\" with crowds, speeches and music every. Saturday. An empty dinner table set up in. Hostage. Square in. Tel. Aviv highlights the captives' absence. Eli. Stivi, whose son was kidnapped by militants, says he wants. Israel to resume talks to secure the release of more hostages. The slogan \"Bring. Them. Home. Now\" and paraphernalia such as yellow ribbons and black. T-shirts featuring photos of hostages have helped attract supporters. Celebrities including. Jerry. Seinfeld have visited the plaza to show solidarity. The families concede they have no influence over. Hamas, which says. Israel needs to implement a cease-fire before any hostage negotiations resume. Some relatives say. Israel needs to do just that to bring. Hamas to the table. Others have called on the government to bus thousands of. Palestinian prisoners to the border with. Gaza to make clear its willingness to pay for the release of its hostages. Netanyahu has said that unrelenting military pressure on. Hamas is what will get the hostages back, and. Israel has refused to pause fighting before negotiations. On. Dec. 15, the families were hit with another wave of anger and frustration when. Israeli forces in. Gaza mistakenly killed three. Israeli hostages who had escaped. That night, hundreds of relatives and supporters gathered outside the. Kirya buildingthe. Tel. Aviv military headquarters, and where. Israel's cabinet meets on a regular basis. \"I was screaming at them,\" said. Zohar. Avigdori, who had welcomed two family members back from captivity in. November. \"If now is not the time to be mad, when is?\". The next day, the. Families. Forum helped set up about 20 tents outside the. Kirya. Defense. Minister. Yoav. Gallant and. Benny. Gantz, another member of. Israel's war cabinet, surprised families meet them at. Hostage. Square. Gantz offered assurances that. Israel had the option to make a new offer to. Hamas. On. Thursday, the. Israeli military said it had determined that the killing of the three hostages was preventable and that it had shared its findings with soldiers to avoid another hostage tragedy. Netanyahu, meeting the families that day, tried to reassure them of. Israel's commitment to reaching a hostage deal. \"We are holding contacts at this very moment,\" he said, according to a statement about the meeting. \"We are working to return them all. This is our goal.\". At the. Kirya on a recent weekday, the families blocked the driveway at 29 minutes after each hour, to commemorate 629 a.m. on. Oct. 7, when. Hamas attacked. Israel. Their blockade lasted 241 seconds, representing the number of hostages taken into. Gaza that day. \"I came here because. I want a new deal,\" said. Eli. Stivi, whose son. Idan was abducted in the attack on the. Nova music festival. \"I don't want to stop the war, but. I want to start the talks.\". The father, a tech entrepreneur, said he didn't know whether his son was still alive. Of 129 hostages remaining in. Gaza, 23 are dead, according to. Israel. Stivi said he thinks about whether. Idan is cold, wherever he is. Stivi got into his white. Mercedes to drive home for. Shabbat dinner. He would return, he said, to sleep in a tent that night.

A few months ago it launched an investigation into the potential “illegal subsidization” of EVs that might cause “economic injury” to its own producers.

MERIDITH KOHUT FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nBy\nCollin Eaton\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 1, 2024 12:05 am ET\n442\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(7 min)\nA surprise surge in American oil and gas production and exports is helping to keep the world stocked, blunting the impact of widening conflict in the Middle East that has crimped key shipping lanes. \nWhen Iranian-backed Houthi militants began launching missiles and drones at ships crossing the Red Sea near Yemen in October, many feared disruption to the vital shipping lane would drive up energy prices. But oil and gas prices this past month have sunk about 5% and 23%, respectively. \nMore U.S. crude exports flowing to Europe\nSource: Kpler\nCreated with Highcharts 9.0.1\nOther destinations\nEurope\n2020\n'21\n'22\n'23\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nmillion barrels a day\nThat is largely because of record production of U.S. fossil fuels.\nShippers in November moved more oil out of the U.S. than what was produced in Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest member, at a record 4.5 million barrels a day. Likewise, U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, are set to hit a record in December, according to market intelligence firm Kpler. European countries have snapped up more U.S. cargoes in recent months, becoming less reliant on shipments through the Suez Canal, a key Red Sea artery.    \nThe attacks on vessels, which the Houthis say are in retaliation for the Israeli military operation in Gaza, have intensified in recent days. U.S. officials alleged a Dec. 23 attack drone launched directly from Iran struck a Japanese-owned chemical tanker off the coast of India, though Tehran denied that claim.\nThe shipping crisis is expected to raise consumer prices for goods that cross the Red Sea, as hundreds of vessels have been forced to reroute around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. But it is unfolding just as U.S. frackers have caught a second wind that, so far, has countered inflationary effects in energy. \nMany forecasters expected U.S. oil production to grow only modestly in 2023 as frackers responded to investor pleas for conservative spending, allowing the companies to pay off debt and fund dividends and share buybacks. \nIt isn’t entirely clear how long shale companies can keep increasing production at the same fast clip. Shale drillers, especially privately held companies, deployed more rigs in late 2022 in response to higher commodity prices driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Much of the production from the wells they drilled came online recently, but the U.S. rig count dropped in 2023 and drillers have proposed relatively modest budgets for 2024.\nThe Galaxy Leader cargo ship was seized by Houthis on the Red Sea in December. PHOTO: YAHYA ARHAB/SHUTTERSTOCK\nAt the same time, large public shale companies such as EOG Resources, Devon Energy and Diamondback Energy said they have sped up drilling times and are pumping more oil from wells they drilled. The scope and duration of those advances are unclear.\nU.S. oil production had grown to about 13.2 million barrels a day as of October, up almost 900,000 barrels a day from the same month in 2022, according to the Energy Information Administration’s latest available data.\nMeanwhile drillers in Guyana and Brazil also swiftly increased their output in 2023, though neither gained as much as U.S. shale.  \nAll of that has kept the world’s oil inventories far more flush than traders expected months ago, subduing oil prices. In response, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies moved in November to cut output further to prop up prices. U.S. crude prices have dropped about 21% in the fourth quarter, and were down about 6% in December.  \nOne beneficiary of cheaper oil: President Biden, whose Energy Department has recently accelerated its purchases of crude meant to replace the barrels it sold off in 2022 from the nation’s strategic petroleum reserve. The government had sold the barrels at higher prices that year, and is now competing more actively with international oil buyers.\nTankers have recently carried more U.S. crude to the Netherlands, the U.K., Italy, Spain, France, Germany and other countries as more of Russia’s crude has flowed to Asia following Western sanctions. U.S. oil shipments to Europe have jumped 34% since this time in 2022 and 82% from before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Kpler data show.\nLonger term, the Red Sea situation could bring more business for U.S. LNG shippers, which are building out export capacity at Gulf Coast facilities and are vying for lengthy contracts with big buyers in Europe, analysts said.\nShale drillers such as Range Resources have helped push the U.S. to record levels of natural gas production. PHOTO: NATE SMALLWOOD FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nThe percentage of LNG tankers set to pass through the Suez Canal has dropped to its lowest point in at least a decade. At the same time, American LNG exports are expected to rise to a record of more than 8 million metric tons in December, up from the previous record of 7.7 million in October, Kpler projected.\nAdvocates for fracking have long said fast-growing U.S. shale production could help stabilize markets in times of crisis, in part, because of the speed with which a shale well produces. But analysts warned shale’s market influence would diminish if Iran became directly embroiled in the conflict. \n“When you’re talking about a minor disruption here or there, surging U.S. production helps,” said Robert McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy. “But Iran is a problem shale can’t solve, because Iran threatens the Strait of Hormuz, through which 18 million barrels a day flows.” \nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nHow will conflict in the Middle East affect the oil industry? Join the conversation below.\nAlso, with oil prices lower than in late 2022, many shale drillers large and small are planning to keep spending roughly flat in 2024, in line with investors’ preferences. That is expected to curtail production growth. U.S. crude-oil production is expected to increase some 300,000 barrels a day in 2024, Rapidan Energy projects. \nSpending by U.S. producers is expected to increase about 2% to a collective $115 billion in 2024. That is compared with a 19% spending boost in 2023, and still well below the annual average of $150 billion from 2010 to 2015, the industry’s heyday, according to a survey conducted by James West, an analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI.\n“They don’t spend like drunken sailors anymore,” West said. \nAdvertisement\nWest said U.S. shale companies have made some incremental improvements in efficiency, such as in the time it takes to drill a well. But the recent production boost is more the result of a large rig count in late 2022 and early 2023, he said. \nAmerican LNG exports are projected by Kpler to rise to a record of more than 8 million metric tons in December, up from the prior record of 7.7 million in October. PHOTO: CAMILLE FARRAH LENAIN FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\nAs of Friday, the number of drilling rigs active in the U.S. had fallen by about 20% since the end of 2022, according to Baker Hughes. \nSome analysts also expect continued consolidation in the oil patch to curtail growth, as large oil companies purchase smaller rivals. In October, Exxon Mobil agreed to buy Pioneer Natural Resources for nearly $60 billion in stock, and Chevron announced it would snap up Hess for $53 billion in stock.\nThough the U.S. shale industry has moved away from its hypergrowth phase, there is a dawning realization following global conflicts that demand for oil and gas will remain healthy for years to come, said John Arnold, billionaire philanthropist and former natural-gas trader. \n“I think there is growing confidence from investors that the industry isn’t going away anytime soon,” Arnold said.\nWrite to Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 2, 2024, print edition as 'Shale Has World Awash in Oil as Conflicts Abound'.\nSHOW CONVERSATION (442)\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nMarine Le Pen Found Guilty of Embezzlement, Banned From Next Election\nIf Vaccines Don’t Cause Autism, What Does?\nMike Waltz Is Losing Support Inside the White House\nNo More Mr. Nice Guy.

         "Title: China’s Xi Is Resurrecting Mao’s ‘Continuous Revolution’ With a Twist\n\nChina’s Xi Is Resurrecting Mao’s ‘Continuous Revolution’ With a Twist\nThe Chinese leader has made his corruption purge—with millions punished—a pillar of his rule. It risks paralyzing his party.\nChinese leader Xi Jinping recently met with senior officers of the armed forces stationed in Nanning, southern China. LI GANG/XINHUA/ZUMA PRESS\nBy Chun Han WongFollow\nUpdated Jan. 1, 2024 12:08 am ET\nSAVE\nSHARE\nTEXT\n386 RESPONSES\nListen to article\n(10 minutes)\nChinese rulers have long used campaigns against corruption to sideline rivals and consolidate power. Xi Jinping is increasingly tying his authority to a new variation: a purge that never ends.\nWith echoes of Mao Zedong’s “continuous revolution,” Xi has sent fear rippling through the ranks of the Communist Party for more than a decade with the largest campaign against corruption in modern Chinese history. It is now threatening to petrify the party as it tries to steer the world’s second-largest economy through its greatest period of uncertainty in a generation.\nSince he came to power in 2012, party enforcers have punished roughly five million people for offenses as serious as abuse of power and as innocuous as creating excessive red tape.\nIn 2023 alone, the unrelenting campaign swept through the worlds of finance, food, healthcare, semiconductors and sports—taking down scores of senior officials, bankers, hospital directors and even soccer administrators. China’s foreign and defense ministers went missing in the summer before being abruptly removed from their posts, leading to suspicions that they, too, have been purged. Beijing’s recent ouster of a dozen senior military and defense-industry officials from the national legislature and a government advisory body have fueled speculation about a broader shake-up of the country’s military establishment.\nLi Shangfu hasn’t made a public appearance since late August and U.S. officials say the Chinese Defense Minister is being ousted from his post. Li is the latest of several senior Chinese officials to disappear without explanation. Photo: How Hwee Young/Shutterstock\nThere is no end in sight. The Chinese leader recently outlined his plans for how the campaign would proceed in the next few years and has even targeted the very agency tasked with carrying it out.\nCritics of Xi say the campaign’s extension into a second decade is a result of his refusal to accept structural changes and greater transparency that are necessary for cleaner governance. \nAn anticorruption campaign in China is extending into a second decade as its economy, the world’s second largest, faces several challenges. PHOTO: NG HAN GUAN/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThe Chinese leader has instead cast the blame on the moral failings of individuals, while doubling down on his centralized and opaque style of governance, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Xi’s remarks, party directives and official data. Only a continual cleansing can ensure the party remains potent and pure, he has argued.\n“Battling corruption is the most thorough form of self-revolution,” Xi said days before starting his third term as party chief in October 2022. “As long as the soil and conditions conducive for corruption continue to exist, the fight against corruption can’t cease for a moment.”\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWSJ China\nExclusive insights on the contest between the U.S. and China, brought to you by the WSJ’s top China correspondent.\nPreview\nSubscribe\nSuch an assertion clears the way for Xi to use disciplinary purges indefinitely as a way to enforce fealty, through fear, to himself and his vision.\n“In China, campaigns are supposed to be an intense but short burst of enforcement,” said Yuen Yuen Ang, a political-science professor at Johns Hopkins University. “Xi has invented a paradoxical policy tool: a perpetual campaign.”\nWhile the forever purge buttresses Xi’s authority, it also has instilled a constant apprehension and reluctance to act decisively among party members as challenges mount. The economy is struggling to shake its Covid hangover. Youth unemployment has skyrocketed, and the property market and consumer sentiment have tanked. Meanwhile, debt is piling up and foreign investors are increasingly turning their backs on the Chinese market.\nAdvertisement\nIn the early years of the campaign, many officials saw it as a longer and more ambitious version of previous efforts. Roughly 180,000 people were disciplined for infractions in 2013, a number that climbed to some 621,000 in 2018, the year Xi proclaimed a “crushing victory” over corruption.\nOfficial data show at least half a million people being disciplined every year since 2017—around four times as many as were typically punished annually when Xi’s predecessor held power from 2002 to 2012. \nBy some measures, corruption has indeed fallen under Xi. Berlin-based advocacy group Transparency International ranked China 65th in its 2022 index on perceptions of public-sector corruption in 180 countries and territories, an improvement from 80th out of 176 jurisdictions in 2012, the year Xi took power. \nAdvertisement\nA survey published in 2020 by Harvard University’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation found that the proportion of Chinese citizens who saw officials as being generally “clean” rose to more than 65% in 2016 from roughly 35% in 2011. \nXi Jinping has outlined plans for how his anticorruption campaign would proceed in the next few years. PHOTO: NOEL CELIS/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nThere are other indications, however, that Xi hasn’t curbed corruption so much as pushed it deeper into the shadows. The new five-year plan for fighting graft released in September pledges to curb new and hidden forms of corruption where officials use murky corporate structures and “revolving doors” between the public and private sectors to seek illicit gains.\nA recent case involving Zhang Jing, a former local official in southwestern China, shows corruption has remained insidious and persistent. Zhang’s offenses date to the early 2000s, when as a township party chief, he started accepting “red envelopes” of cash from entrepreneurs and friends in return for providing inside information about government projects, according to an official account.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nCan Xi Jinping’s strategy guide China through economic crisis? Join the conversation below.\nWhen one of those entrepreneurs was detained by authorities in 2013, Zhang grew frightened, to the point of asking a feng shui master to pray for his safety, according to the account. He tried to cover his tracks, such as by returning a bribe to one entrepreneur through a bank transfer—so that he could cite bank records to plead innocence—before taking the bribe again in cash later.\nAuthorities didn’t catch up with Zhang until 2022, when the party detained and eventually expelled him.

         "China's. Xi. Is. Resurrecting. Mao's 'Continuous. Revolution'. With a. Twist. The. Chinese leader has made his corruption purgewith millions punisheda pillar of his rule. It risks paralyzing his party. Chinese leader. Xi. Jinping recently met with senior officers of the armed forces stationed in. Nanning, southern. China. LI. GANGXINHUAZUMA. PRESS 10 minutes. Chinese rulers have long used campaigns against corruption to sideline rivals and consolidate power. Xi. Jinping is increasingly tying his authority to a new variation a purge that never ends. With echoes of. Mao. Zedong's \"continuous revolution,\". Xi has sent fear rippling through the ranks of the. Communist. Party for more than a decade with the largest campaign against corruption in modern. Chinese history. It is now threatening to petrify the party as it tries to steer the world's second-largest economy through its greatest period of uncertainty in a generation. Since he came to power in , party enforcers have punished roughly five million people for offenses as serious as abuse of power and as innocuous as creating excessive red tape. In alone, the unrelenting campaign swept through the worlds of finance, food, healthcare, semiconductors and sportstaking down scores of senior officials, bankers, hospital directors and even soccer administrators. China's foreign and defense ministers went missing in the summer before being abruptly removed from their posts, leading to suspicions that they, too, have been purged. Beijing's recent ouster of a dozen senior military and defense-industry officials from the national legislature and a government advisory body have fueled speculation about a broader shake-up of the country's military establishment. Li. Shangfu hasn't made a public appearance since late. August and. U.S. officials say the. Chinese. Defense. Minister is being ousted from his post. Li is the latest of several senior. Chinese officials to disappear without explanation. There is no end in sight. The. Chinese leader recently outlined his plans for how the campaign would proceed in the next few years and has even targeted the very agency tasked with carrying it out. Critics of. Xi say the campaign's extension into a second decade is a result of his refusal to accept structural changes and greater transparency that are necessary for cleaner governance. An anticorruption campaign in. China is extending into a second decade as its economy, the world's second largest, faces several challenges. The. Chinese leader has instead cast the blame on the moral failings of individuals, while doubling down on his centralized and opaque style of governance, according to a. Wall. Street. Journal analysis of. Xi's remarks, party directives and official data. Only a continual cleansing can ensure the party remains potent and pure, he has argued. \"Battling corruption is the most thorough form of self-revolution,\". Xi said days before starting his third term as party chief in. October . \"As long as the soil and conditions conducive for corruption continue to exist, the fight against corruption can't cease for a moment.\". NEWSLETTER. SIGN-UP. Exclusive insights on the contest between the. U.S. and. China, brought to you 's top. China correspondent. Such an assertion clears the way for. Xi to use disciplinary purges indefinitely as a way to enforce fealty, through fear, to himself and his vision. \"In. China, campaigns are supposed to be an intense but short burst of enforcement,\" said. Yuen. Yuen. Ang, a political-science professor at. Johns. Hopkins. University. \"Xi has invented a paradoxical policy tool a perpetual campaign.\". While the forever purge buttresses. Xi's authority, it also has instilled a constant apprehension and reluctance to act decisively among party members as challenges mount. The economy is struggling to shake its. Covid hangover. Youth unemployment has skyrocketed, and the property market and consumer sentiment have tanked. Meanwhile, debt is piling up and foreign investors are increasingly turning their backs on the. Chinese market. In the early years of the campaign, many officials saw it as a longer and more ambitious version of previous efforts. Roughly 180,000 people were disciplined for infractions in , a number that climbed to some 621,000 in , the year. Xi proclaimed a \"crushing victory\" over corruption. Official data show at least half a million people being disciplined every year since around four times as many as were typically punished annually when. Xi's predecessor held power from to . , corruption has indeed fallen under. Xi. Berlin-based advocacy group. Transparency. International ranked. China 65th in its index on perceptions of public-sector corruption in 180 countries and territories, an improvement from 80th out of 176 jurisdictions in , the year. Xi took power. A survey published in 's. Ash. Center for. Democratic. Governance and. Innovation found that the proportion of. Chinese citizens who saw officials as being generally \"clean\" rose to more than 65 in from roughly 35 in . Xi. Jinping has outlined plans for how his anticorruption campaign would proceed in the next few years. There are other indications, however, that. Xi hasn't curbed corruption so much as pushed it deeper into the shadows. The new five-year plan for fighting graft released in. September pledges to curb new and hidden forms of corruption where officials use murky corporate structures and \"revolving doors\" between the public and private sectors to seek illicit gains. A recent case involving. Zhang. Jing, a former local official in southwestern. China, shows corruption has remained insidious and persistent. Zhang's offenses date to the early s, when as a township party chief, he started accepting \"red envelopes\" of cash from entrepreneurs and friends in return for providing inside information about government projects, according to an official account. Can. Xi. Jinping's strategy guide. China through economic crisis? Join the conversation below. When one of those entrepreneurs was detained ,. Zhang grew frightened, to the point of asking a feng shui master to pray for his safety, according to the account. He tried to cover his tracks, such as by returning a bribe to one entrepreneur through a bank transferso that he could cite bank records to plead innocencebefore taking the bribe again in cash later. Authorities didn't catch up with. Zhang until , when the party detained and eventually expelled him. In. March , he was sentenced to four years in jail after being found to have taken more than 1.24 million yuan worth of bribes, equivalent to around 175,000 at current rates. \"I didn't pull back from the precipice and confess to the organization in time,\" he said in his confession. \"Instead. I racked my brains to try to cover up my crimes.\". Investigations involving more visible forms of corruption have fallen in recent years, according to official data. People punished for dining on public money dropped to around 9,300 in from 13,600 in , and those disciplined for holding lavish events such as weddings and banquets slipped below 3,000 from 7,000 over the same period. Meanwhile, the number of people disciplined for improper giving and receiving of giftsa more hidden form of grafthave steadily climbed, rising to 23,000 in from about 6,800 in . The party's top internal watchdog, the. Central. Commission for. Discipline.

While the filing didn’t provide evidence of a romantic relationship, it makes a bombshell claim: that Willis hired her alleged boyfriend, and they both financially benefited from the arrangement.\nThe motion Monday stunned Atlanta’s tightknit legal community and injected uncertainty into one of the highest-profile prosecutions in the country. Lawyers in Georgia say at a minimum, the allegations in the Monday filing raise questions about why Willis sought Wade’s services.\n“My understanding is that he has no felony jury trial experience,” said Chris Timmons, an Atlanta defense lawyer who has prosecuted cases under the same racketeering law used against Trump, known as a RICO statute.\nWade isn’t qualified to serve as a court-appointed defense lawyer in the Trump case, according to Monday’s motion. To pick up such an assignment, a lawyer needs to have tried “at least two criminal trials of similar offenses,” according to a 2022 document from the Fulton County Superior Court.\nWade’s lack of relevant experience “would be concerning in any complex felony case, let alone one that is a multi-defendant RICO case,” said Timmons, an ABC News contributor.\nFulton County special prosecutor Nathan Wade last year in court. PHOTO: ALYSSA POINTER/GETTY IMAGES\nA spokesman for Willis didn’t respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Previously, the spokesman said Willis’s office would respond to the allegations in its own filing.

He later became a municipal judge in the Atlanta suburb of Marietta, hearing misdemeanor cases and traffic offenses. Between 2012 and 2016, Wade ran three times—unsuccessfully—for a judgeship on the Cobb County Superior Court.\nWade has been paid nearly $654,000 in legal fees by Willis’s office since January 2022, according to Fulton County financial records. The last payment to his firm shown in those records is from early October; if Wade continued to receive payments at a similar rate to the rest of the contract, he could have earned close to $1 million, according to the motion. \nWade has frequently appeared in court in the Trump case. At a Dec. 1 hearing, Wade responded to arguments by Trump’s lawyer that a trial in late 2024 would interfere with the election. “The district attorney has made it clear that she has no interest in interfering or getting involved with this presidential election,” Wade said.\nFormer President Donald Trump departing the Fulton County Jail after turning himself into authorities on Aug. 24, 2023.

She has asked a judge to make those records public, arguing they should never have been sealed in the first place.\nAdvertisement\nWade filed for divorce from his wife, Joycelyn Wade, in November 2021, one day after his first contract with Willis’s office took effect. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Willis has been subpoenaed to testify in Wade’s divorce proceeding, according to a court filing. A lawyer for Joycelyn Wade didn’t immediately provide comment.\nAccording to Merchant’s motion, Wade billed the county for 24 hours of work on a single day in November 2021, shortly after getting the special prosecutor job.\nAndrew Fleischman, a criminal defense lawyer in Atlanta who frequently litigates against Willis’s office, called such a claim a red flag. “Most judges would be given serious pause by that number,” Fleischman said.\nMerchant’s filing also alleges that Willis improperly paid Wade from county forfeiture funds.\nThe Fulton County Courthouse.in Atlanta.

In 2020, a sheriff asked Wade’s law firm to review operations at a jail where several inmates had died.\nA local television station sued the sheriff and Wade that year, saying Wade was doing a bogus investigation and was unqualified for the role. The station said the probe was manufactured so that the sheriff would have pretext for denying a public records request, citing a pending investigation.\nWade denied any wrongdoing. A judge ordered the county to provide some documents to the television station, 11Alive, and the lawsuit was settled.\nPorter, the former district attorney for Gwinnett County, said that the alleged romantic relationship doesn’t inherently threaten the prosecution of the indictment. “The inappropriate relations stuff…it’s certainly not grounds to dismiss the case,” said Porter, who added that he knows Willis professionally. He said the allegations still may be awkward for Willis.\nIf Willis were to recuse herself or be disqualified from the case, the rest of her office would likely be removed as well and it would have to be assigned to another district attorney, he said.\nIt’s possible, among myriad next steps including Willis responding to the allegations, that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation could investigate the claims, said Scott Key, an attorney in private practice who is a former president of the Georgia Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. The Georgia Bar Association may eventually step in, but it is unlikely it would investigate on its own unless or until a formal complaint was made, he said.\nThe motion filed by Merchant argues Willis and Wade may themselves be open to racketeering charges on the alleged misuse of funds. \n“Willis has proven herself that it doesn’t take much to invoke a RICO liability,” Key said.\nJames Fanelli contributed to this article.\nWrite to Mariah Timms at mariah.timms@wsj.com, Jan Wolfe at jan.wolfe@wsj.com and Cameron McWhirter at Cameron.McWhirter@wsj.com\nAppeared in the January 11, 2024, print edition as 'Trump Prosecutor’s Hiring Is Scrutinized'.\nVideos\nAdvertisement\nMost Popular News\nMarine Le Pen Found Guilty of Embezzlement, Banned From Next Election\nIf Vaccines Don’t Cause Autism, What Does?\nMike Waltz Is Losing Support Inside the White House\nNo More Mr. Nice Guy.

Joe Biden, Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump agree on something. All three presidential candidates want to import pharmaceutical price controls from countries with socialized healthcare systems and outsource drug regulation to foreign governments.\nOPINION: POTOMAC WATCH\nThe Case of the Missing U.S. Defense Secretary\n20:38\n1x\nSUBSCRIBE\nAdd to Queue\nExplore Audio Center\nThat’s the point of Florida’s plan to import drugs from Canada, which the Food and Drug Administration approved last week. Mr. DeSantis pitched the idea in 2019 to lower drug prices, and the Trump Administration teed it up for FDA approval with enabling regulations. “We will finally allow the safe and legal importation of drugs from Canada,” Mr. Trump said in 2020.\nNow Mr. DeSantis is taking a victory lap. “Canada has the same drugs. They’re like 25 cents on the dollar, and part of that is because of the way their government suppresses the price,” Mr. DeSantis said in Iowa. “Bottom line is that if I can get 25 cents on the dollar, I can save $100 million, $200 million in Florida.” This boast comes with several big caveats.\nDrug importation has gained support among Republicans who say Americans are subsidizing drugs for the rest of the world. There’s some truth in this. Drug prices in Canada are more than 50% lower than in the U.S. That’s largely because Canada’s government can compel manufacturers of patented drugs to reduce their prices.\nBut Americans also get access to more innovative drugs, and sooner. Drugs were approved 468 days earlier in the U.S. than in Canada for the 218 medicines authorized in both countries between 2013 and 2019, according to the Fraser Institute.\nFederal law generally prohibits the importation of prescription drugs sold in foreign countries that haven’t been approved by the FDA. This closed system protects Americans from adulterated, counterfeit and mislabeled drugs. The FDA inspects plants that produce medicine for the U.S. market. Not so plants that make drugs for foreign countries.\nThe risk of counterfeit or contaminated drugs isn’t trivial. The FDA recently said it is investigating counterfeit versions of the diabetes drug Ozempic that turned up “in the legitimate U.S. drug supply chain and has seized thousands of units of the product.” It added that “sterility of the needles cannot be confirmed, which presents an increased risk of infection.”\nMr. Trump could have used trade negotiations to prevent Canada and other countries with drug price controls from extorting American drug makers and “free-riding” on Americans. Instead, his Administration issued regulation on how states could obtain FDA approval to import drugs from Canada.\nPresident Biden followed with an executive order directing FDA to work with states that have proposed importation programs. Florida is the first to gain approval, and Texas, Colorado and New Mexico, among others, hope to join it. Florida says its plan could save $150 million annually.\nDon’t bet on it. Drug makers say they’ll reduce sales to Canada if their products will be exported to the U.S. Canada has warned it would restrict drug exports to the U.S. to prevent shortages. On Monday Ottawa said it “is taking all necessary action to safeguard the drug supply and ensure Canadians have access to the prescription drugs they need.”\nThe FDA also added costly safeguards to Florida’s program. The state will have to ensure that the drugs it imports have been tested and comply with FDA standards and labelling requirements. Mr. DeSantis takes pride in his state’s small government, but his plan will require a new bureaucracy to implement.\nThe real point of the Biden-Trump-DeSantis mind-meld is to import foreign drug price controls that Congress won’t pass. This will erode U.S. intellectual property protection that rewards innovation and investment. This isn’t a recipe for making America stronger, or Americans healthier.\nAdvertisement\nWonder Land: Surveying the record of his three years in office, Mr. Biden has decided his re-election turns on two events: the Capitol riot of 2021 and Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse the 2020 presidential election results in several states.

Canada are more than 50 lower than in the. U.S. That's largely because. Canada's government can compel manufacturers of patented drugs to reduce their prices. But. Americans also get access to more innovative drugs, and sooner. Drugs were approved 468 days earlier in the. U.S. than in. Canada for the 218 medicines authorized in both countries between and , according to the. Fraser. Institute. Federal law generally prohibits the importation of prescription drugs sold in foreign countries that haven't been approved . This closed system protects. Americans from adulterated, counterfeit and mislabeled drugs. The. FDA inspects plants that produce medicine for the. U.S. market. Not so plants that make drugs for foreign countries. The risk of counterfeit or contaminated drugs isn't trivial. The. FDA recently said it is investigating counterfeit versions of the diabetes drug. Ozempic that turned up \"in the legitimate. U.S. drug supply chain and has seized thousands of units of the product.\". It added that \"sterility of the needles cannot be confirmed, which presents an increased risk of infection.\". Mr. Trump could have used trade negotiations to prevent. Canada and other countries with drug price controls from extorting. American drug makers and \"free-riding\" on. Americans. Instead, his. Administration issued regulation on how states could obtain. FDA approval to import drugs from. Canada. President. Biden followed with an executive order directing. FDA to work with states that have proposed importation programs. Florida is the first to gain approval, and. Texas,. Colorado and. New. Mexico, among others, hope to join it. Florida says its plan could 150 million annually. Don't bet on it. Drug makers say they'll reduce sales to. Canada if their products will be exported to the. U.S. Canada has warned it would restrict drug exports to the. U.S. to prevent shortages. On. Monday. Ottawa said it \"is taking all necessary action to safeguard the drug supply and ensure. Canadians have access to the prescription drugs they need.\". The. FDA also added costly safeguards to. Florida's program. The state will have to ensure that the drugs it imports have been tested and comply with. FDA standards and labelling takes pride in his state's small government, but his plan will require a new bureaucracy to implement. The real point of the. Biden-Trump-DeSantis mind-meld is to import foreign drug price controls that. Congress won't pass. This will erode. U.S. intellectual property protection that rewards innovation and investment. This isn't a recipe for making. America stronger, or. Americans healthier. Wonder. Land. Surveying the record of his three years in office,. Mr. Biden has decided his re-election turns on two events the. Capitol riot of and. Mr. Trump's efforts to reverse the presidential election results in several states. Images. Getty. ImagesZuma.

PHOTO: CHARLIE NEIBERGALL/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nAnkeny, Iowa\nRon DeSantis is nearing the end of his third pep rally of the day, surrounded by roughly 150 fans in a dimly lit baseball-themed sports bar (try the Ty Cobb Salad), when he tells the story that sums up his presidential appeal. “We had a Category 5 hurricane hit in Southwest Florida,” he says. It washed out a bridge and a causeway, stranding thousands of islanders from their homes. The estimate to rebuild? Six months.\n“Now, these are not state bridges. I had no control over them,” Mr. DeSantis says. But his help was sought, and the governor demanded no bureaucracy and no red tape. “The first bridge, to Pine Island,” he recounts, “we were able to reopen it in three days.” In the pub, the Iowans cheer. “A lot of these politicians,” he adds, picking up force, “they’re lily-livered. They don’t want to ever do anything where they take a risk, because they don’t want to get blamed.”\nThen he slides into home plate. “Those islands probably would have died if they had to wait six months, so we got it done,” he says. “You can expect nothing less from me as president.”\nThat last line would have sounded more like a promise, and less like bravado, when Mr. DeSantis entered the 2024 race last year as a favorite. But on Monday the Iowa caucuses will officially begin the GOP’s nominating process, and all the surveys are predicting a big-league win for Donald Trump. The former president leads the RealClearPolitics polling average with 52% support, as Mr. DeSantis vies for a distant second, all but tied near 17% with Nikki Haley.\nMr. Trump would have the public believe that it’s all over except the voting. Yet there are signs that he and his advisers are worried about falling short of expectations, and any story that ends with the party choosing someone else probably has to start in Iowa. Is there a contingent of voters who are delighted to tell pollsters they want Mr. Trump but who won’t venture out on a cold caucus night? The temperature forecast for Monday includes a minus sign.\nA surprisingly strong second-place finisher, the theory goes, could vault out of Iowa with some velocity toward New Hampshire, which holds its primary on Jan. 23. As George H.W. Bush put it after winning Iowa: “What we will have is momentum. We will look forward to ‘Big Mo’ being on our side, as they say in athletics.” Forget for a moment that Bush said this in 1980, before being thumped by Ronald Reagan. The legend of Big Mo has given hope to generations of presidential laggards.\nOn the lookout for this cryptid, the candidates have been crisscrossing the snowy corn stubble, speaking in restaurants and women’s clubs to 100 or more voters at a time. Iowa’s median age is 39, middling for states, but the caucus crowd isn’t a random sample. When asked for her age—so sorry, the editors demand to know—one woman suggests: “You can say, ‘73, looks like 68.’ ” As the pump-up playlist in Cedar Falls turns to Twisted Sister, a white-haired man in a sweater vest shuffles up to a pack of reporters to ask if they know how to turn down the music. “For chrissake,” he growls, “we’re not 20.”\nOnce they take the stage, the contrast between Ms. Haley and Mr. DeSantis is the difference between poetry and prose. Ms. Haley gives a longer speech and often skips Q&A, while leaving plenty of time to take photos and say hello one on one. She knows how to deploy a self-deprecating joke or a pause after a heavy point. Twice at a winery in Indianola, someone in the audience sneezes, and Ms. Haley drops a “bless you” into the middle of her political arguments. “Every single time. It’s great,” a woman whispers to a friend, charmed by this small show of manners.\n“She’s a transformational leader. She’s not only empathetic, she’s got goals—goals that we need as a country,” says a Quad Cities supporter who has seen Ms. Haley three times. Or a similar testimonial: “She is not polarizing. She’s respectable. When she speaks, she doesn’t elevate herself by attacking others, particularly on a personal level.” At a Haley event it doesn’t take much effort to find a voter who claims to be a longtime Democrat. One of her applause lines is to cite a survey that shows her beating President Biden by 17 points.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis prepares to speak at a town hall in Des Moines, Iowa, Jan. 9. PHOTO: JIM LO SCALZO/SHUTTERSTOCK\n“What happens if you have a double-digit win, going into D.C.?” Ms. Haley asks. “That’s a mandate to stop this wasteful spending and get our economy back on track. That’s a mandate to get our kids reading again and get our education back to the basics. That’s a mandate to secure our border, with no more excuses. That’s a mandate to bring law and order back to our country. And that’s a mandate for a strong America that we can be proud of. Don’t y’all want that again?”\nMr. DeSantis’s campaign style is almost the inverse. He gives brief opening remarks but spends most of his stage time calling on voters and answering questions shouted from the throng. He doesn’t do dramatic pauses. The end of his stump speech is written as soaring rhetoric, with citations to the Founders and a line about how the best view from an airplane landing in Washington isn’t on the left side of the jetliner, looking down on the National Mall, but from a window on the right, facing Arlington Cemetery.\nHe blows through the whole set piece at 85 mph, barely breathing between sentences. It’s Gettysburg and Normandy, delivered with all the emotion of a waiter who knows the dinner specials by heart and has six other tables waving for attention. The flip side of this personality type, though, is that Mr. DeSantis actually seems to revel in the details of policy and exercising power.\nAdvertisement\nWhile Ms. Haley suggests the federal government somehow can “get our kids reading again,” Mr. DeSantis floats an ambitious proposal to take school choice national via a federal tax credit for corporate donations to private scholarships. This is a model with a history in his state. “We serviced 100,000 kids a year in Florida for $1 billion, between administrative costs and scholarship,” he says. If the feds “did $25 billion or, man, $50 billion, which is budget dust to these guys, you’re talking about millions of kids that could be liberated.”\nMr. DeSantis’s nuts-and-bolts approach doesn’t put off his supporters. “For me, what you do speaks so loudly, I cannot hear what you say,” one explains. In other words, look at his record. “Just utter competence,” another man says. “He’s the only one who is presidential material.” Some voters mention a Florida connection: They escaped to Mr. DeSantis’s state amid the pandemic or have family who moved there. The place works, they say. Imagine if America worked.\nA surprise, or perhaps not, is how much Ms. Haley and Mr. DeSantis agree, at least directionally. Both would like to shrink the federal government, cut spending, secure the border, build the wall, and ease restrictions on oil-and-gas drilling so the U.S. can be “energy dominant,” a phrase both have used. They both want term limits on Congress, as well as other far-reaching—and, frankly, far-fetched—structural reforms. Ms. Haley renews her call to subject elected officials over 75 to “mental competency tests.” Mr. DeSantis pitches a presidential line-item veto.\nOne place they diverge is Ukraine. Why should voters care about Vladimir Putin’s invasion? That’s “a legitimate question,” Ms. Haley says, but for her it isn’t a rhetorical one. She fears Mr. Putin’s appetites won’t be satisfied, and a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally might be next: “This is about preventing war. This has always been about preventing war.” As Mr. Putin rearms his forces with “drones from Iran, missiles from North Korea,” Ms. Haley argues that the U.S. equipment and ammo sent to Ukraine’s defenders is “only 3.5% of our defense budget—that’s it.”\nHer rival is nearer to Mr. Trump’s view. “Obviously Biden has no clue as to kind of how this is all going to end, and so I think they’ve really been funding a stalemate there,” Mr. DeSantis says. “A president that’s responsible, I think, would find a way to bring this to a conclusion, because I don’t think it’s in our interests to just be doing $100 billion a year indefinitely. For what?”\nMr. DeSantis has a strong on-the-ground organization in Iowa, and he has visited all 99 counties. But he hasn’t gained in the polls. Voters who want to waylay the front-runner, Mr. Trump, might worry at this point that Mr. DeSantis is too far behind to catch up. He has fallen to 6% in the New Hampshire average. Momentum can carry only so far.\nMs. Haley, on the other hand, is a solid second in New Hampshire, with 29% to Mr. Trump’s 43%. Also notable is that 12% of “Live Free or Die” primary voters had been backing the most anti-Trump candidate around, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who dropped out Wednesday. There are plenty of ifs, but could this be the year to prove Big Mo is no rumor? If Ms. Haley surges in Iowa, and if she starts to look like a real threat to Mr. Trump, and if this attracts Mr. Christie’s base, and if it carries forward to South Carolina . . .\nMr. Peterson is a member of the Journal’s editorial board.\nWonder Land: Surveying the record of his three years in office, Mr. Biden has decided his re-election turns on two events: the Capitol riot of 2021 and Mr. Trump’s efforts to reverse the 2020 presidential election results in several states.

         "Jan. 10, 615 pm. ET 212 9 min. Former. United. Nations. Ambassador. Nikki. Haley smiles at a. Fox. News town hall in. Des. Moines,. Iowa,. Jan. 8. Ankeny,. Iowa. Ron. DeSantis is nearing the end of his third pep rally of the day, surrounded by roughly 150 fans in a dimly lit baseball-themed sports bar try the. Ty. Cobb. Salad, when he tells the story that sums up his presidential appeal. \"We had a. Category 5 hurricane hit in. Southwest. Florida,\" he says. It washed out a bridge and a causeway, stranding thousands of islanders from their homes. The estimate to rebuild? Six months. \"Now, these are not state bridges. I had no control over them,\". Mr. DeSantis says. But his help was sought, and the governor demanded no bureaucracy and no red tape. \"The first bridge, to. Pine. Island,\" he recounts, \"we were able to reopen it in three days.\". In the pub, the. Iowans cheer. \"A lot of these politicians,\" he adds, picking up force, \"they're lily-livered. They don't want to ever do anything where they take a risk, because they don't want to get blamed.\". Then he slides into home plate. \"Those islands probably would have died if they had to wait six months, so we got it done,\" he says. \"You can expect nothing less from me as president.\". That last line would have sounded more like a promise, and less like bravado, when. Mr. DeSantis entered the race last year as a favorite. But on. Monday the. Iowa caucuses will officially begin the. GOP's nominating process, and all the surveys are predicting a big-league win for. Donald. Trump. The former president leads the. RealClearPolitics polling average with 52 support, as. Mr. DeSantis vies for a distant second, all but tied near 17 with. Nikki. Haley. Mr. Trump would have the public believe that it's all over except the voting. Yet there are signs that he and his advisers are worried about falling short of expectations, and any story that ends with the party choosing someone else probably has to start in. Iowa. Is there a contingent of voters who are delighted to tell pollsters they want. Mr. Trump but who won't venture out on a cold caucus night? The temperature forecast for. Monday includes a minus sign.

         "Title: Reports of DEI’s Death Are Greatly Exaggerated\n\nAdvertisement\nOPINION\nCOMMENTARY\nFollow\nReports of DEI’s Death Are Greatly Exaggerated\nSo long as the implicit-association test is in circulation, the myth of a mostly racist U.S. will live.\nBy Hal R. Arkes\nJan. 10, 2024 6:14 pm ET\n585\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(6 min)\nPHOTO: GETTY IMAGES\nDEI is down but not out. Several states, universities and corporations signaled their retreat from diversity, equity and inclusion programs last year. Yet despite these developments, the movement remains alive and well thanks in part to the implicit-association test: a popular tool that has been used to claim that most of the U.S. is racially prejudiced.\nThree scholars first introduced the concept in a 1998 article in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology titled, “Measuring Individual Differences in Implicit Cognition: The Implicit Association Test.” The article describes how researchers measured how quickly respondents associated “good” and “bad” words with white or black faces. When people more quickly paired good words with “white” and bad words with “black,” they were deemed implicitly biased.\nIn a 2007 article in the European Review of Social Psychology, another group of academics found that approximately 68% of whites manifested a biased result. This quickly morphed into the widespread assertion, in some of the press, that 68% of whites are racially prejudiced.\nThe test has since become a fixture in DEI training programs nationwide, with universities and businesses often using it during mandatory training sessions for students and employees. Harvard University’s Project Implicit reports that more than 20 million people have taken its online administration of the test on various topics, including implicit racial bias.\nThe tool, it turns out, is highly suspect. To see why, we must examine it with the two most important measures used for any other psychological test: reliability and validity.\nTest-retest reliability refers to the extent to which a person who takes the test twice obtains the same result. If a test taker’s scores on two repeated administrations of the same test are totally unrelated, its reliability would be zero. If the two scores were identical, its score would be 1. According to measurement scholars Jum Nunnally and Ira Bernstein, the threshold for acceptable test-retest reliability is 0.7. In 2015 one of the authors of the original 1998 article relayed that the reliability of the test is between 0.5 and 0.6, rendering it unreliable as a psychological test.\nThe next measure is validity, or whether the test measures what it’s supposed to measure. If you’re trying to analyze the factors that affect a baseball player’s salary, you would identify such metrics as his batting average, fielding errors, runs batted in, etc., and then compare them with the same statistics and salaries of his fellow players in a regression equation. Using this method in meta-analyses of the implicit-association test, several scholars have found that “implicit bias” accounts for between 2% and 5.6% of prejudicial behavior. Even Mahzarin Banaji and Anthony Greenwald, two of the test’s most prominent advocates, have written that “attempts to diagnostically use such measures risk undesirably high rates of erroneous classifications.” The test, in other words, is an extremely feeble predictor of behavior.\nConsider these problems in another context. Suppose someone invented a guilt detector to replace the jury system in American courtrooms. Defendants would be administered the test, and those deemed guilty would be sent to prison.\nSay the detector deemed 68% of people to be guilty, but the tool’s reliability was a mere 0.5 or 0.6 and it identified only 2% to 5.5% of the reasons someone may be guilty. America’s jails would be jam-packed with innocent people. So it is with the implicit-association test, which falsely classifies huge numbers of white Americans as bigots.\nDespite the tool’s inadequacies, one group has benefited enormously from its popularity: the companies that perform antibias training. In 2018 I asked a “debiasing trainer” how she measures the success of her company’s training. She said it assesses knowledge about implicit bias before training and then again after it. But that isn’t useful. Trainees necessarily know much more about any topic after they’ve learned it. What matters is whether the training caused people to be less biased, which isn’t measured.\nI asked if there was any assessment of whether the training helped group morale, hiring practices, and personal interactions. She said no, because the training company doesn’t return to measure such factors.\nDoes it use a control group that receives no training or alternate training to ascertain if the test-based training is superior? “Of course not,” she said. “The company doesn’t want to pay for a no-training group.” With such techniques, it would be virtually impossible to provide a truly rigorous approach to measuring—much less fighting—actual bias.\nThough the implicit-training test says very little, governments, universities, companies and nonprofits continue to force it on countless people. It makes sense for those who stand to profit from it, but it’s ruinous for the health of our polity. So long as the test remains in circulation, the divisive and destructive DEI enterprise will be alive and well.\nMr. Arkes is an emeritus professor of psychology at Ohio State University.\nAdvertisement\nWonder Land: College Presidents' spineless response to antisemitic protests are the culmination of academia’s plummet the past 50 years which has included grade inflation, speech codes, trigger warnings and ultimately cancel culture.

Ryan Barber\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 10, 2024 5:59 pm ET\n2075\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(10 min)\nTwo House committees voted along party lines to recommend holding Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress for not complying with subpoenas, sending the matter to the full House. Photo: Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg News\nWASHINGTON—Hunter Biden’s unexpected appearance at a House committee hearing set off a chaotic debate in the chamber over whether he should be held in contempt of Congress for ignoring subpoenas late last year and angered some Republican lawmakers who called his presence a political stunt.  \nHis showing Wednesday at a House Oversight Committee hearing was the latest move in a combative legal strategy aimed at portraying the president’s son as a victim of partisan attacks by House Republicans. A vote to hold him in contempt would set up a potential third criminal prosecution that could coincide with his father’s re-election campaign. \n“You are the epitome of white privilege coming into the Oversight committee, spitting in our face, ignoring a congressional subpoena to be deposed,” said Rep. Nancy Mace (R., S.C.). “What are you afraid of?”\n“Hunter Biden should be arrested right here, right now and go straight to jail,” she said.\nDemocrats pointed to public comments made in the past by Republican committee leaders saying that they would allow Hunter Biden to testify publicly in an open hearing—and dared Republicans to put him on the witness stand right then and there. \n“Who wants to hear from Hunter right now, today? Anyone? Come on. Who wants to hear from Hunter?” said Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D., Fla.), suggesting that the panel vote on the idea. “Nobody over there wants to hear from the witness.”\nWednesday’s proceedings stemmed from Hunter Biden’s decision not to comply with subpoenas that the House Judiciary and the House Oversight and Accountability committees issued late last year. Members of the two panels voted along party lines Wednesday evening to recommend holding Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress, sending the matter to the full House. The votes came after each panel held hours of simultaneous hearings in different rooms on his failure to appear for a deposition in a congressional impeachment probe into whether President Biden benefited from his family’s business dealings. \nHunter Biden attending a House Oversight Committee meeting on Wednesday. PHOTO: KENT NISHIMURA/GETTY IMAGES\nInstead of sitting for closed-door questioning, the president’s son gave a brief speech on Capitol Hill where he said he would answer any “legitimate questions” from House investigators. The younger Biden offered to testify but insisted on doing so publicly out of concern about selective leaks of his testimony. House Republicans said he couldn’t dictate the terms of his appearance and needed to first answer questions privately.\nSenior White House staff and Biden allies are uncomfortable that Hunter Biden keeps putting himself in the spotlight and wish he would maintain a lower profile, according to people familiar with the situation. They see little upside in reminding voters of his antics, which involve failure to pay taxes on time and inappropriate behavior as he struggled with addiction to drugs and alcohol.\n“If you’re sitting in the White House right now, you’re like, ‘Please, Hunter Biden. We know your dad loves you. Please stop talking in public.’ This is not helpful to any of them for him to be out there,” said former Biden White House press secretary Jen Psaki in December, speaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press” shortly after Hunter Biden defied the subpoenas. “The White House would like him to probably go away right now.”\nBy appearing at the Oversight hearing Wednesday, Hunter Biden sought to highlight his willingness to cooperate with the panel’s inquiry on his own terms.\nPresident Biden is seeking a second term. PHOTO: MANDEL NGAN/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\nHunter Biden sat in the audience between his lawyers Abbe Lowell and Kevin Morris and listened to the early part of the hearing. They stood up and left after less than an hour, as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.) was speaking. “Excuse me, Hunter, apparently you’re afraid of my words,” she said. Hunter Biden didn’t make an appearance at the simultaneous Judiciary Committee hearing on the same topic.\nLowell read a statement outside the Oversight committee room, accusing Republicans of using his client as a way to attack the president and repeating that his client has offered to work with the committee several times in the past, including an offer made Wednesday. Ignoring those efforts, Lowell said, shows “they cared little for the truth.” \nThe twin House proceedings Wednesday set Congress on a path that could add to Hunter Biden’s legal difficulties, though he might not be prosecuted even if he is held in contempt. The contempt-of-Congress charge carries a maximum sentence of a year in prison and a fine of up to $100,000. If the Republican-controlled House of Representatives approves the measures, the matter will be referred to the Justice Department. \nAdvertisement\nSeparately, Hunter Biden is due in court Thursday in Los Angeles for an initial appearance on tax charges related to failing to file returns on time and for allegedly claiming false deductions on some of the forms he did file. \nThe contempt-of-Congress resolution puts the president’s family drama in the spotlight as the 2024 presidential campaign gets fully under way. President Biden has pitched himself as an antidote to former President Donald Trump’s chaotic tenure in office. But his son’s actions have given Trump, the likely GOP nominee, ammunition to undermine that claim.\nFormer President Donald Trump campaigned in Iowa earlier this month. PHOTO: CHENEY ORR/REUTERS\nOn Tuesday, Hunter Biden’s art dealer appeared behind closed doors to testify before House Oversight members about the buyers of paintings by the president’s son, who has launched a new career as an artist. Three of the 10 buyers of Biden’s art were Democratic donors and their purchases amounted to 70% of his proceeds, according to people familiar with the testimony. \nThe lion’s share was to Morris, the Hollywood lawyer who sat with Hunter Biden on Wednesday and has become personally close to him, the people said.\nHunter Biden has opted for a combative legal strategy on several fronts. In recent months, he has filed lawsuits against Rudy Giuliani and the Internal Revenue Service over alleged breaches of his privacy.\nIn July, the younger Biden was set to admit to failing to pay his taxes in 2017 and 2018, as part of a plea deal in which he would have avoided prosecution on a gun charge. But the deal dissolved during a hearing in which federal prosecutors and Biden’s legal team disagreed in open court about the immunity it granted the president’s son from potential additional charges.\nHunter Biden was later indicted on three felony gun charges related to a 2018 firearm purchase. In that case, he has sought to subpoena Trump and former Attorney General William Barr as he prepares to raise a defense that his prosecution on felony gun charges stems from an “unrelenting pressure campaign” by the former president and his Republican allies.\nIn December, Hunter Biden was charged with nine tax offenses in an indictment that accused him of failing to pay his taxes on time between 2016 and 2019 and claiming false deductions for various personal expenses, including membership to a sex club, pornography and his daughter’s law-school tuition.\nIf the House votes to hold Hunter Biden in contempt, he would be referred to the Justice Department for prosecution. Such a referral would put the Justice Department in the fraught position of determining whether to pursue another criminal case against the president’s son. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.\nA White House spokesman, Ian Sams, said the contempt resolution and a separate hearing Wednesday, which is part of a GOP effort to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, represent “baseless attacks” on Biden’s White House and family. \nDemocrats used the Oversight hearing to raise questions about the legitimacy of the underlying impeachment probe into President Biden, noting that after a year investigating, the committee has yielded nothing about the president that rises to the standard for removal from office.\nFormer Trump aide Steve Bannon was found guilty in 2022 and later sentenced to four months in prison. PHOTO: KEVIN LAMARQUE/REUTERS\n“We were here for a year [and] you did not lay a glove on Joe Biden,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), the top Democrat on the panel. “Why are we here? We can’t go after Joe Biden, he’s clean. Let’s go after Hunter Biden.”\nRepublicans noted that there is nothing unusual about their investigative process, which is to bring in witnesses for closed-door interviews before holding subsequent public hearings. Indeed, Raskin used this playbook for a probe he was part of during the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and was insistent that witnesses followed the subpoenas.\n“Please tell your children out there in America, if you get a subpoena to go before Congress, if you get a subpoena to go to the court, go,” Raskin said on MSNBC in July 2022 as a former Trump aide was defying a subpoena.\nIn past administrations, both Democratic and Republican, the Justice Department has often declined to pursue contempt-of-Congress cases. But in most of those cases, the Justice Department considered whether to prosecute government officials who asserted executive privilege in refusing to appear for questioning or turn over documents to Congress, legal experts said.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat lies ahead for Hunter Biden? Join the conversation below.\nFollowing referrals from Congress, the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington brought contempt charges in recent years against former Trump aides Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro in connection with their defiance of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\nCongress also voted, largely on party lines, to hold former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and Dan Scavino, the deputy chief of staff for communications in the Trump White House, in contempt of Congress on similar grounds. But prosecutors declined to bring criminal charges against those two.\nBannon was found guilty in 2022 and later sentenced to four months in prison. He has remained free pending an appeal of his conviction. Navarro was found guilty in September and is set to be sentenced later this month.\nAs a private citizen, Hunter Biden hasn’t asserted executive privilege in his dealings with House Republicans. For prosecutors, the decision to bring charges could be complicated by questions about the validity of the underlying investigation, his offer to testify—albeit only in public—and the criminal charges he already faces in the two other cases, legal experts said. \nHunter Biden and his legal team objected to a closed-door deposition because he feared that House Republicans would cherry-pick his responses to present him in a negative light.\nWrite to Annie Linskey at annie.linskey@wsj.com and C.

Biden's art dealer appeared behind closed doors to testify before. House. Oversight members about the buyers of paintings 's son, who has launched a new career as an artist. Three of the 10 buyers of. Biden's art were. Democratic donors and their purchases amounted to 70 of his proceeds, according to people familiar with the testimony. The lion's was to. Morris, the. Hollywood lawyer who sat with. Hunter. Biden on. Wednesday and has become personally close to him, the people said. Hunter. Biden has opted for a combative legal strategy on several fronts. In recent months, he has filed lawsuits against. Rudy. Giuliani and the. Internal. Revenue. Service over alleged breaches of his privacy. In. July, the younger. Biden was set to admit to failing to pay his taxes in and , as part of a plea deal in which he would have avoided prosecution on a gun charge. But the deal dissolved during a hearing in which federal prosecutors and. Biden's legal team disagreed in open court about the immunity it granted the president's son from potential additional charges. Hunter. Biden was later indicted on three felony gun charges related to a firearm purchase. In that case, he has sought to subpoena. Trump and former. Attorney. General. William. Barr as he prepares to raise a defense that his prosecution on felony gun charges stems from an \"unrelenting pressure campaign\" president and his. Republican allies. In. December,. Hunter. Biden was charged with nine tax offenses in an indictment that accused him of failing to pay his taxes on time between and and claiming false deductions for various personal expenses, including membership to a sex club, pornography and his daughter's law-school tuition. If the. House votes to hold. Hunter. Biden in contempt, he would be referred to the. Justice. Department for prosecution. Such a referral would put the. Justice. Department in the fraught position of determining whether to pursue another criminal case against the president's son. A. Justice. Department spokesman declined to comment. A. White. House spokesman,. Ian. Sams, said the contempt resolution and a separate hearing. Wednesday, which is part of a. GOP effort to impeach. Homeland. Security. Secretary. Alejandro. Mayorkas, represent \"baseless attacks\" on. Biden's. White. House and family. Democrats used the. Oversight hearing to raise questions about the legitimacy of the underlying impeachment probe into. President. Biden, noting that after a year investigating, the committee has yielded nothing about the president that rises to the standard for removal from office. Former. Trump aide. Steve. Bannon was found guilty in and later sentenced to four months in prison. \"We were here for a year and you did not lay a glove on. Joe. Biden,\" said. Rep. Jamie. Raskin. D.,. Md., the top. Democrat on the panel. \"Why are we here? We can't go after. Joe. Biden, he's clean. Let's go after. Hunter. Biden.\". Republicans noted that there is nothing unusual about their investigative process, which is to bring in witnesses for closed-door interviews before holding subsequent public hearings. Indeed,. Raskin used this playbook for a probe he was part of during the investigation into the. Jan. 6, , attack on the. Capitol and was insistent that witnesses followed the subpoenas. \"Please tell your children out there in. America, if you get a subpoena to go before. Congress, if you get a subpoena to go to the court, go,\". Raskin said on. MSNBC in. July as a former. Trump aide was defying a subpoena. In past administrations, both. Democratic and. Republican, the. Justice. Department has often declined to pursue contempt-of-Congress cases. But in most of those cases, the. Justice. Department considered whether to prosecute government officials who asserted executive privilege in refusing to appear for questioning or turn over documents to. Congress, legal experts said. What lies ahead for. Hunter. Biden? Join the conversation below. Following referrals from. Congress, the. U.S. attorney's office in. Washington brought contempt charges in recent years against former. Trump aides. Steve. Bannon and. Peter. Navarro in connection with their defiance of the. House committee that investigated the. Jan. 6, , attack on the. Capitol and efforts to overturn the election. Congress also voted, largely on party lines, to hold former. Trump chief of staff. Mark. Meadows and. Dan. Scavino, the deputy chief of staff for communications in the. Trump. White. House, in contempt of. Congress on similar grounds. But prosecutors declined to bring criminal charges against those two. Bannon was found guilty in and later sentenced to four months in prison. He has remained free pending an appeal of his conviction. Navarro was found guilty in. September and is set to be sentenced later this month. As a private citizen,. Hunter. Biden hasn't asserted executive privilege in his dealings with. House. Republicans. For prosecutors, the decision to bring charges could be complicated the validity of the underlying investigation, his offer to testifyalbeit only in publicand the criminal charges he already faces in the two other cases, legal experts said. Hunter. Biden and his legal team objected to a closed-door deposition because he feared that. House. Republicans would cherry-pick his responses to present him in a negative light. No. More.

         "Title: SEC Approves Bitcoin ETFs for Everyday Investors\n\nAdvertisement\nMARKETS & FINANCE\nREGULATION\nSEC Approves Bitcoin ETFs for Everyday Investors\nThe exchange-traded funds will allow investors to buy bitcoin as easily as stocks or mutual funds\nBy\nVicky Ge Huang\nFollow\nand\nPaul Kiernan\nFollow\nUpdated Jan. 10, 2024 5:56 pm ET\n527\nGift unlocked article\nListen\n(8 min)\nILLUSTRATION: ILLUSTRATION BY ALEXANDRA CITRIN-SAFADI/WSJ\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission voted Wednesday to allow mainstream investors to buy and sell bitcoin as easily as stocks and mutual funds, a decision hailed by the industry as a game changer.\nThe SEC decision clears the way for the first U.S. exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin to be sold to the public. Expectations of U.S. regulatory approval for such funds drove the price of bitcoin to the highest level in about two years. The digital currency traded just below $46,000 late Wednesday, up from $17,000 in January 2023.\nUntil now, everyday investors who wanted to buy and sell digital currencies have had to either trade on crypto exchanges and incur hefty transaction fees or purchase products that track bitcoin in less direct ways. At least half a dozen bitcoin-futures ETFs are already on the market. Those funds use futures contracts to provide exposure to bitcoin price moves, though they have been criticized for often straying from bitcoin’s price. \nAll 11 applications filed by asset managers including BlackRock BLK -2.19%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\n, Fidelity Investments, ARK Investment Management, Invesco, WisdomTree WT -2.29%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\n, Bitwise Asset Management, Valkyrie and Grayscale Investments have been greenlighted to list. The new funds, known as spot-bitcoin ETFs because they buy and sell the digital currency itself, are expected to begin trading on Thursday.\n“Today is a monumental day in the history of digital assets,” Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at bitcoin ETF issuer Hashdex, said in a statement.\nCrypto assets were mixed after the SEC’s decision. Ether, the second largest digital currency rose nearly 10%. Coinbase Global COIN -7.77%\ndecrease; red down pointing triangle\n, the largest publicly traded crypto exchange whose stock price tends to move in tandem with bitcoin, fell 1.4% in after-hours trading. Coinbase is listed as the custodian on eight of the 11 spot-bitcoin ETF applications.\nThe SEC previously rejected applications for so-called spot bitcoin ETFs on the grounds that the underlying market is vulnerable to fraud and market manipulation. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said more regulation and investor protection is needed before a swath of investors get access to the crypto market.\nGensler acknowledged the latest ETF applications were similar to ones the SEC had denied in the past. But he said a court ruling last year in favor of crypto asset manager Grayscale had compelled the change.\n“Based on these circumstances and those discussed more fully in the approval order, I feel the most sustainable path forward is to approve the listing and trading of these spot bitcoin ETP shares,” he said.\nHe added the SEC “did not approve or endorse bitcoin.”\n“Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,” Gensler said.\nThe argument that the bitcoin market is rife with fraud and easily manipulated got a boost Tuesday when the SEC’s official X account was hacked.\nThe SEC order Wednesday noted that all the exchanges seeking to list bitcoin ETFs had a surveillance-sharing agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where bitcoin futures are listed. That agreement “can be reasonably expected to assist in surveilling for fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,” the order said. It cited the high correlation between bitcoin-futures prices and the price of bitcoin itself.\nTwo of the SEC’s five commissioners, Democrats Caroline Crenshaw and Jaime Lizarraga, voted against the decision. Crenshaw called the move “unsound and ahistorical,” saying it puts the agency “on a wayward path that could further sacrifice investor protection.”\nThe SEC’s two Republican commissioners, Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, joined Gensler in voting to approve the ETFs.\n“Today marks the end of an unnecessary but consequential saga,” Peirce said. She said the SEC’s previous rejections used perplexing logic and drove individual investors to less-efficient ways of gaining exposure to bitcoin.\nAdvertisement\nThe approval order, posted on the SEC’s website Wednesday, detailed how the agency has reversed its thinking about the risk of market manipulation in bitcoin in response to the August court decision.\nEXPLORE BUY SIDE FROM WSJ\nBuy Side is independent of The Wall Street Journal newsroom.\nBest Bitcoin ETFs\nBest Stock Trading Platforms\nWhat Is Portfolio Diversification\nAfter losing the Grayscale lawsuit, the SEC said, it studied the correlation between the spot-bitcoin market and the CME bitcoin futures market. Grayscale had claimed that the two markets were closely correlated, and the judges sided with the crypto asset manager in their decision. The SEC said after the new analysis, it is able to conclude that fraud or manipulation that impacts prices in spot-bitcoin markets would likely similarly affect CME bitcoin futures prices.\nThe unauthorized X post Tuesday claimed that the agency had approved these funds. Bitcoin initially jumped and then reversed its gains when the agency later posted that its account was compromised. The SEC said Wednesday that the agency’s Office of the Inspector General and the Federal Bureau of Investigations are now probing the incident.\nGensler has previously taken to X to say that investments in crypto assets can be “exceptionally risky and are often volatile.” Several crypto firms have filed for bankruptcy, and fraudsters continue to exploit the rising popularity of crypto assets to lure individual investors into scams, he had said.\nDespite such risks, many mainstream investors have flocked to crypto assets in recent years, sending prices soaring during the pandemic. In 2022, though, the collapse of several high-profile crypto exchanges caused prices to crash, wiping out $2 trillion in cryptocurrency value. The sector’s implosion culminated with the failure of FTX, the exchange ran by now-convicted crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried.\nThe likelihood of a spot bitcoin ETF being sold to the public appeared low until BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager with a near-perfect record of ETF approvals, threw its hat into the ring in June 2023.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWould you invest in spot bitcoin ETFs? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\nThe new bitcoin funds are expected to face intense competition in a crowded market. Some asset managers have chosen to compete on cost, while others have begun a marketing push. Fees for some of the funds will range from as low as zero in the first six months to as high as 1.5% of assets.\nThe fund approvals could potentially pave the way for some financial advisers to recommend that clients allocate funds to bitcoin. It is far easier for an adviser to recommend an ETF than bitcoin itself, which could require clearing a number of regulatory hurdles.\nBitcoin skeptics said the approval of spot-bitcoin ETFs could set a dangerous precedent for other crypto-asset ETFs to come to market in the future and make it more difficult for the SEC to protect investors. Several asset managers, including BlackRock, ARK, VanEck and Grayscale, have filed applications to launch the first ETFs that track the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether. The SEC faces a final deadline this May to approve or reject some of those funds.\n“This is going to open the floodgates for every type of crypto token and scam you can think of that’s going to be trying to get SEC approval.” said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a group that advocates for tighter financial regulations.\nPubKey, a bitcoin-themed bar in New York, posted a photo on X saying that it would be having an ETF party. “There’s always room in the rocket,” the bar wrote.
